He is the only one who can use six eyes and limitless together.</caption>
<p>Jujutsu Kaisen is an action-adventure manga written by Gege Akutami. It follows Yuji Itadori, a high school kid that eats a cursed finger and hosts the king of curses, Sukuna, in his body. He is later discovered by Gojo and taken to jujutsu school to learn and control Sukuna while the elders watch him. </p>
<h3>Gojo Vs. Sukuna </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-spoilers-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the latest Jujutsu Kaisen spoilers</a> release, the manga indicated a long-awaited fight between Gojo and Sukuna. Considering that Megumi&#8217;s body is now under the possession of Sukuna, it is highly likely that Gojo will first figure out a way to save Megumi first. Gojo set the dates for December 24th on Christmas Eve for the fight. Given that there is time for it to happen, we may see Gojo saving Megumi first, then probably Killing Sukuna when he takes over Yuji&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_268776" align="aligncenter" width="1178"]<img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-268776" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2.png" alt="Jujutsu Kaisen Spoilers " width="1178" height="597" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2.png 1178w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2-300x152.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2-1024x519.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2-768x389.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Chapter-214-2-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1178px) 100vw, 1178px" /> Sukuna was an enemy of the Yamato family in the past. He was also worshipped as a deity by some people.</caption>
<p>This fight was indicated at the beginning of the Jujutsu Kaisen series itself when Yuji asked Gojo if he would win the fight against Sukuna, and Gojo said he would win. Gege Akutami also talked about the ending in a jump fiesta. He said one of the first years, or Gojo, would die at the end of the series. It could be anyone. Considering Yuji was already chosen to be killed initially, it may end that way. Or all of them can end up dead. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Kenjaku and Sukuna made a pact to set the world as it was during the period of their reign. Thus initiating the culling game. Kenjaku is sure to be killed in the series. He had planned all of this meticulously for years and strategized the whole game for thousands of years.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_297816" align="aligncenter" width="1920"]<img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-297816" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans.jpg" alt="Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 220 raw scans" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans.jpg 1920w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jujutsu-Kaisen-chapter-220-raw-scans-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /> Suguru Geto is one of the 4 jujutsu sorcerers that is a special grade. His body gets taken over by Kenjaku after being killed by Rica Chan.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Nobara Kugisaki </h3>
<p>The Jujutsu Kaisen manga still didn&#8217;t indicate what happened to Nobara after the Shibuya incident. When Yuji asked Megumi what happened to Nobara, he didn&#8217;t answer, which can mean that she is dead or critical and may die at any time. Some fans are predicting that she survived and is probably training to better herself. Her status is hidden from the readers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jujutsu Kaisen manga officially returns from break in 13 Days <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JujutsuKaisen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JujutsuKaisen</a> <a href="https://t.co/Q8BgqQVfMb" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Q8BgqQVfMb</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The importance of death can be connected to what Gege Akutami said at the Jump fiesta that all 4 might end up dead. If Nobara dies, Gojo may fight Sukuna in Megumi&#8217;s body. Sukuna is extremely evil and manipulative. He may switch bodies during the fight between Yuji and Megumi, and maybe Gojo will kill both of them to end Sukuna, or Gojo might kill Megumi and die in the process. Only Yuji will be the only surviving member among the four.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Gojo and Sukuna&#8217;s fight may be the last in the series or maybe the few among the last. Another possibility is that Gojo may die in the fight while saving Megumi, and Megumi may end up killing Yuji when he is hosting Sukuna.</p>
<h3>Where to read Jujutsu Kaisen? </h3>
<p>Whatever may be the outcome, fans are excited and are hoping that the series satisfies everybody. Fans can read Jujutsu Kaisen on <a href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/jujutsu-kaisen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viz media</a> ( the first few and the last 3 chapters are free) and Shuesha&#8217;s official website, <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manga Plus</a>. Crunchyroll and Netflix are hosting the series&#8217; anime in some countries. Season 2 will release soon worldwide. The season will discuss Gojo&#8217;s and Sugoru&#8217;s past and how Kenjaku took over his body.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demon Slayer Season 3 started airing on 9th April 2023, and it released its 3rd episode on 23rd April 2023. Fans all over the world are waiting for Episode 4, which is set to release on 30th April 2023.</p>
<p>Here is all you have to know about the latest episode that is yet to release.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer Season 3 continues to reveal frightening information one after another.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer is a series where Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy, wishes to transform his sister back from a demon to a human.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer is set in a dystopian invaded by demons. Demons go after and devour humans. However, the demons are unable to come out during the day. Humans occasionally perish away and sometimes transform into demons.</p>
<figure id="attachment_306249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-306249" style="width: 1152px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-306249" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more.webp" alt="Demon Slayer Season 3 Episode 4 Release date, spoilers and more" width="1152" height="648" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more.webp 1152w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-300x169.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-768x432.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-150x84.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-306249" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Demon Slayer Season 3</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Tanjiro&#8217;s family was hunted by a demon. Only the eldest sibling turned into a demon after his mother passed away.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer Season 3: All about it.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/demon-slayer-review-season-3-episode-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demon Slayer Season 3</a>, which centers on the Swordsmith Village arc, has already drawn significant attention from fans around the world.<br />
The continuation of the series has guaranteed to be exciting this season. The interest among viewers grows as the plot of Tanjiro&#8217;s experience in Swordsmith Village is explored more in the series.</p>
<p>Even though Muichiro is only a minor character in the series, the fact that he is the Sun-Breathing Technique&#8217;s direct descendant means that he will play a significant part down the road.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer Season 3 Episode 4</h3>
<p>Muichiro rescuing Kotetsu from a monster will be included in the next episode. He&#8217;ll remember Kagaya&#8217;s advice of regaining himself in the middle of the fight.</p>
<p>A flashback of a severely hurt Mucihiro who has just lost his memories will then take place. Kagaya is comforting the youngster while sitting there with his wife, telling him that his memory would return if he has the desire to live.<br />
Kagaya continues by saying that Muichiro must start small and rid his mind of the &#8220;mist&#8221; to do that. Later, Muichiro takes the form of the Mist Hashira, which is the mist he mentions.</p>
<figure id="attachment_306252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-306252" style="width: 1245px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-306252" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2.jpg" alt="Demon Slayer Season 3 Episode 4: Release date, spoilers and more" width="1245" height="700" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2.jpg 1245w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Demon-Slayer-Season-3-Episode-4-Release-date-spoilers-and-more-2-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1245px) 100vw, 1245px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-306252" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Demon Slayer Season 3</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A flashback will then show a severely hurt Mucihiro who has just lost his memories. Kagaya is comforting the youngster while sitting there with his wife, telling him that as long as he has the desire to live, his memory will come back. Muichiro has to start small and eliminate the &#8220;mist&#8221; in his thoughts to do that, Kagaya continues. He alludes to a mist, which subsequently manifests itself as the Mist Hashira, Muichiro&#8217;s alter ego.</p>
<p>In Demon Slayer Season 3, it does, however, imply that the action takes place before Muichiro joins the demon Slayer corps. The series will disclose why Muchiro loses his memory later. His forgotten memories are a direct result of his trauma from being assaulted by a demon and losing his twin brother, but unfortunately will not be addressed in Demon Slayer Season 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a Twitter troll took a swipe at Zendaya, Jennifer Connelly, and so-called “zoomers” in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Ex-Disney child star <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/zendaya-slammed-host-for-commenting-on-her-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendaya</a> who has served a number of iconic looks on red carpets and Connelly, who last starred in Top Gun Maverick have been the target of hate from a Twitter user.</p>
<h3>Twitter user bashes Zendaya</h3>
<p>A Twitter user who goes by @CristusVictor paired an image of a young Connelly with a makeup-free Zendaya. They also went on a rant about how women from the 90s were more attractive than Gen Z-touted celebs.</p>
<p>The troll wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any zoomer who thinks right pic is above average attractive doesn’t understand that in the 90s, A ‘7’ looked like left pic,”</p></blockquote>
<p>The hater continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>“‘Above average’ meant something else back then. There’d be like ten girls as or more beautiful than Connelly working at every chain restaurant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Any zoomer who thinks right pic is above average attractive doesn&#39;t understand that in the 90s, a &quot;7&quot; looked like left pic.</p>
<p>&quot;Above average&quot; meant something else back then. There&#39;d be like ten girls<br />as or more beautiful than Connelly working at every chain restaurant. <a href="https://t.co/rjg9ZPU2g5" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rjg9ZPU2g5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sun Optimist (@CristusVictor) <a href="https://twitter.com/CristusVictor/status/1647082731602362368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The post soon went viral and sparked a fiery debate online with protestors arguing in favor of both women.</p>
<h3>Twitter argues over Hollywood actresses</h3>
<p>One user responded to the post saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jennifer Connelly was a dream girl in the 90s and she’s still a dream girl to much of the same people today. Zendaya will follow a similar path, I’m sure.I don’t understand this need to compare and contrast two entirely different people. Life is not a competition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another user was quick to bash @CristusVictor saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>“You took a pic of a woman with heavy makeup, her hair done and CLEARLY posing, and compared it to an off-guard, no makeup, messy hair pic. You’re definitely trying too hard to prove ur weak point buddy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A third user wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dude Jennifer Connelly has always been a 10 what are you talking about,”</p></blockquote>
<p>While there were several bashing the Twitter user for their post, there were several others who sided with them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303623" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3.jpg" alt="zendaya " width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3.jpg 1200w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/16816915062314-3-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>One user wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The combined number for these two is…generously, an 8.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A second critic wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Truth. I look back on my HS yearbook and half my graduating class in the mid 90s would have been considered ‘hot’ now. Almost universally slim, smiling faces, unjaded, not a trace of SSRI-tainted eyes. It was good, man.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The original poster of the tweet later muted the post saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Muting thread now. Have a blessed Saturday.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jennifer Connelly has been trending on Twitter recently. The 52-year-old said that she expects her co-actor Tom Cruise to get a 95th Academy Awards nomination for his performance in Top Gun Maverick.</p>
<p>Connelly told Variety in an interview,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He’s extraordinary. I think he does an amazing job in the movie. He’s extraordinary as a person and fantastic as an actor, and I think that he is just…perfect. I think that he embodies that character so beautifully… I think he absolutely deserves it,”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Hunter x Hunter&#8217;s return</strong> has sparked hope in the hearts of fans who are eagerly waiting for the series to make a comeback. Although the creator Yoshihiro Togashi has expressed his intent to finish the series, fans continue to hope for its return. On the occasion of Togashi&#8217;s 57th birthday, fans are prioritizing wishing him well, but their desire for the series&#8217; return remains strong.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/hunter-x-hunter-chapter-401-release-date-spoilers-read-online-another-devastating-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunter x Hunter returned in October 2022 for 10 chapters before going into hiatus again.</a></h4>
<p>Some Hunter x Hunter fans are disappointed that Togashi is continuing to work on additional chapters despite his health issues. The author has shared updates about his ongoing work through his personal Twitter account. Despite the frustration, fans remain understanding of Togashi&#8217;s situation, recognizing the debilitating effects of his health problems on his daily life.</p>

He has shared with fans the daily difficulties he faces, such as needing to lie down in the shower and assume a belly-up position when drawing manuscripts. Fans have been incredibly supportive of Togashi and empathetic of the reasons behind the delay of the Hunter x Hunter return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In One Piece Episode 1060, the anime adaptation of the Wano Arc continues as the Straw Hat Pirates engage in an epic battle against Kaido and his Beast Pirate crew. As the War for Wano rages on, Monkey D. Luffy takes on Kaido in a fierce struggle for supremacy, while the rest of the Straw Hats confront their own unique challenges within the isolated nation of Wano.</p>
<p>The upcoming episode of One Piece also features Roronoa Zoro, the Straw Hat Swordsman, embroiled in a brutal one-on-one fight against King, one of Kaido&#8217;s top commanders. With the Wano Arc presenting some unique story beats for Zoro, the preview for the episode teases an upcoming power-up for the skilled swordsman.</p>
<figure id="attachment_306143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-306143" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-306143" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060.jpg" alt="One Piece Episode 1060" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060.jpg 1280w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Piece-Episode-1060-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-306143" class="wp-caption-text">One Piece Episode 1060</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/one-piece-episode-1059-release-date-watch-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the stakes continue to rise in the War for Wano</a>, each member of the Straw Hat crew must draw upon their unique skills and strengths to help turn the tide of battle. Fans of the series are eagerly anticipating One Piece Episode 1060 to see how the crew will fare in their ongoing struggle against Kaido and his forces, and to witness Zoro&#8217;s anticipated upgrade in action.</p>
<p>After the time skip that led to the Straw Hat Pirates disbanding in order to increase their individual strengths, Zoro was the last member to reunite with his comrades on the Thousand Sunny. The isolated nation of Wano appears to be a fitting environment for Zoro, as the swordsman feels right at home in the often unruly country. Despite having been fighting Kaido and his forces for some time now, Zoro was able to join his friends in an effort to bring some semblance of peace to Wano.</p>
<p>While the Wano Arc has already concluded in the One Piece manga, the <a title="One Piece anime" href="https://comicbook.com/category/one-piece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Piece anime</a> still has several significant events to cover before the War for Wano reaches its conclusion.</p>
<h3>One Piece Episode 1060: Zoro&#8217;s power-up</h3>
<p>Throughout the history of One Piece, Zoro has wielded some impressive weapons. But it appears that in Wano Country, the Straw Hat Swordsman may have obtained his most powerful weapon yet. Based on both the preview for the upcoming episode and Zoro&#8217;s recent performance in his fight against King, it&#8217;s clear that he has made significant progress in achieving his dream of becoming the world&#8217;s greatest swordsman.</p>

<p>Unlike fighters such as Luffy and Kaido, whose strength is largely derived from their Devil Fruits, Zoro is a character who has honed his abilities through sheer physical training and willpower. As the One Piece manga enters its final saga, it remains to be seen just how much stronger Zoro can become.</p>
<p>Given his dedication to becoming the greatest swordsman in the Grand Line, it&#8217;s an intriguing prospect to consider if Zoro will ultimately achieve his goal before the series reaches its conclusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before becoming a Hollywood star, Zendaya was a child actor and got her first acting role at Disney&#8217;s Shake It Up. The show aired from 2010 to 2013. At the time the actress was a teenager, but unlike many, she refused to do kissing scenes on-screen. In an interview in 2021, the Spider-Man: No Way Home actress revealed why she refused to do kissing scenes on the Disney show.</p>
<h3>A young Zendaya made her Disney debut</h3>
<p><iframe width="1038" height="584" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J7jsBILZAOU" title="One Direction to be on Shake It Up? Bella Thorne and Zendaya talk about their love for 1D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Zendaya was only 14 when she starred alongside Bella Thorne in the popular teen dance show. She played Rocky Blue, sharing kisses with her costars Deuce Martinez (Adam Irigoyen) and Logan Hunter (Leo Howard).</p>
<p>A first kiss is always special. Zendaya wanted to experience the feeling and refused to kiss her co-stars on the show.</p>
<p>She told British Vogue during the interview,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I remember being on Shake It Up and being like, &#8216;I&#8217;m not gonna do this. I&#8217;m going to kiss him on the cheek because I haven&#8217;t been kissed yet so I don&#8217;t want the kiss to be on camera.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Zendaya is not in a rush to settle down</h3>
<figure id="attachment_299350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-299350" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-299350" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria-1024x576.webp" alt="zendaya " width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria-300x169.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria-768x432.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria-150x84.webp 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Holland-opens-up-about-starring-in-Euphoria.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-299350" class="wp-caption-text">Tom Holland wants to settle down</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, Zendaya is 26. Yet, she remains private about her relationships and love life. When photos of her kissing Spider-Man co-star Tom Holland leaked, she kept mum and avoided revealing too much about her relationship and dating life. <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/zendaya-slammed-host-for-commenting-on-her-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendaya</a> also maintains that no matter what&#8217;s going on in her personal life, she&#8217;s not in a rush to settle down.</p>
<p>The Euphoria star revealed in an interview,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been like, &#8216;I want to do this at this time, then from this age, I want to do this.&#8217; One day I&#8217;ll have a family, but I&#8217;m not trying to put a number on it, it&#8217;ll happen if it&#8217;s meant to happen,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The actress is focused on her career and has already planned out her future. She revealed to Vogue that she wants to pursue directing as a career in the future.</p>
<p>She said in 2019:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to live in a box. I want to be able to push myself. I think before I was feeling too comfortable, so I want to prove to others, and myself, that I can do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She went on to add,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just want to continue to do what I love, and that&#8217;s acting. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>She then shared that &#8220;it brings (her) joy, and as long as (she) can continue to do that and tell stories, (she)&#8217;ll be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zendaya has already achieved a lot of success in her career at such a young age. She and Tom have a lot more to achieve and fans will be happy to see them settle down and start a family together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 26, 2023, alleged spoilers for the full summary of One Piece Chapter 1082 were released, revealing exciting news about the characters&#8217; lives and significant updates on the world. Despite fans&#8217; disappointment that the focus of the series has not yet shifted back to Egghead, it appears that the upcoming issues will feature his return.</p>
<p>One Piece Chapter 1082 provides important information about the Cross Guild, which is depicted as being well-received by the general public in the series&#8217; world. Additionally, readers get a glimpse into how the Marines respond to the bounties placed on the Cross Guild and the casualties resulting from their actions.</p>
<h3>One Piece Chapter 1082 offers an exhilarating affirmation of life as it introduces even more updates on the world of the series.</h3>
<h4>Detailed plot revelations</h4>

<p>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1082🔥</p>
<p>▪︎ Thanks to Redon (<a href="https://twitter.com/mugiwara?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Mugiwara</a>) <a href="https://t.co/vxCJhCoPrM" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vxCJhCoPrM</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ONE PIECE (ワンピース) Spoilers (@OP_SPOILERS2023) <a href="https://twitter.com/OP_SPOILERS2023/status/1651206219984666624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Supposedly complete summary spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1082 suggest that the chapter opens with a news report announcing the death of Captain T-Bone, who was allegedly killed by a citizen looking to claim the bounty on his head. The scene then shifts to Marine headquarters, where Sengoku and Tsuru are discussing the growing danger posed by the Cross Guild.</p>
<p>Afterward, Hina arrives and converses with them, prompting Sengoku to inquire about Garp&#8217;s whereabouts. She replies that Garp departed a few days ago with SWORD and Kujaku to rescue Koby. Sengoku and Tsuru express disbelief as the narrative switches to Karai Bari Island, the Cross Guild&#8217;s headquarters. Meanwhile, in One Piece Chapter 1082, Buggy sends money to the family of T-Bone&#8217;s killer. The scene does not disclose the exact amount of T-Bone&#8217;s bounty. However, it does reveal that the assassin is expected to join the Cross Guild, and Buggy pledges to safeguard him from the Marines.</p>
<p>The scene then reveals that the Cross Guild&#8217;s vessel, which has a clown theme, has been constructed, with Buggy serving as its figurehead, much to everyone&#8217;s amusement. When Crocodile and Mihawk see the ship, they begin to pummel Buggy, with his original crewmates standing by and doing nothing.</p>
<p>In One Piece Chapter 1082, the two actual leaders of the Cross Guild inquire as to why they must travel on that ship, and Crocodile subsequently elaborates on his Utopia strategy. He desires to establish a nation called &#8220;Utopia&#8221; using the Cross Guild, which will be impervious to any danger. Mihawk advises Crocodile to gather more strength before pursuing his ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Buggy, on the other hand, opposes Crocodile&#8217;s plan, arguing that it is not what genuine pirates do. This sets off a flashback featuring Shanks and Buggy, which occurred 24 years ago in Loguetown on the day of Gol D. Roger&#8217;s execution. It&#8217;s a continuation of the flashback scene of the two displayed during Whitebeard and Shanks&#8217; conversation in Chapter 434.</p>
<p>One Piece Chapter 1082 features a flashback where Buggy expresses his disappointment in Shanks for not wanting to search for the One Piece together after Gol D. Roger&#8217;s death. Buggy had hoped Shanks would become the next Pirate King and was angry that he was giving up on that dream. In the present, Buggy discusses Shanks&#8217; recent actions with Mihawk and Crocodile, expressing his anger and saying that it fires him up.</p>
<p>In One Piece Chapter 1082, Buggy declares his ambition to become the Pirate King, stating that he is now a Yonko like Shanks. However, Crocodile beats him up and points out that piracy is a business, and Buggy has no plans or preparations. Mihawk questions Buggy&#8217;s expectation that the Cross Guild can defeat people like Shanks, Blackbeard, and Luffy just on Buggy&#8217;s orders. Buggy responds that they don&#8217;t need to defeat them all, but only to take the treasure first. He takes a microphone and encourages the Cross Guild members to remember why they went out to sea in the first place and to join him in taking the One Piece for themselves.</p>

<p>In One Piece Chapter 1082, the Cross Guild members cheer Buggy on while Crocodile and Mihawk are shown to be shocked and angry at their clown partner. The scene then shifts to the Kamabakka Queendom, where the Revolutionary Army&#8217;s base is located. There is commotion as someone arrives, revealed to be Sabo, who has returned safely. Sabo explains that he was not on the Lulusia Kingdom when Im-sama destroyed the island. Instead, he was on a ship taking some Lulusia citizens who wanted to join the Revolutionary Army to the Queendom. Sabo then joins Monkey D. Dragon and Emporio Ivankov in the meeting room, saying he&#8217;ll tell them the entire truth about what happened at Mariejois during the Reverie as the chapter comes to a close.</p>

<p>While hundreds of thousands of viewers watched Barry and Succession on the premiere night, the views increased by more than 289% later on the streaming platform. The numbers got drastically increased almost 4 times later on the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to know how to claim Facebook settlement, then this article will be the perfect read for you. Facebook might have to pay out $725 million in compensation to all those who used Facebook between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. When the news broke out, many assumed it might be a scam.</p>
<p>But this isn’t any scam. Facebook had been involved in a 5-year-old class action privacy lawsuit. The final hearing of the case is scheduled on September 7, 2023. So what’s this back story, and how can you get paid out of this $725 million pool?</p>
<figure id="attachment_302790" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-302790" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-302790 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action.webp" alt="How To Claim Facebook Settlement?" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action.webp 1200w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action-300x169.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action-768x432.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-settlement-action-150x84.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-302790" class="wp-caption-text">How To Claim Facebook Settlement?</figcaption></figure>
<h2>What is this case all about?</h2>
<p>The case traces its origins back to the 2016 US Presidential campaign.<br />
Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm based in the UK, was handling Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign. The firm managed to obtain private data on Facebook users and then used it for building voter profiles. This massive privacy breach was used for unlawful political favours.</p>
<p>In 2018 the class action litigation was filed. Furthermore, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica accessed the private data of at least 87 million user profiles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">don’t forget to submit y’all’s settlement claims for the facebook lawsuit. I’m getting my $3 idc.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>I didn’t file any case; how am I eligible for compensation?</h2>
<p>You are eligible to receive compensation even if you didn’t file the case. Under the<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/gwyneth-paltrows-ski-lawsuit-not-worthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> class litigation</a> action, one or a few plaintiffs can file a lawsuit on behalf of those who have been affected directly/indirectly. </p>
<h2>How can I file the claim?</h2>
<p>The claim form is <a href="https://facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on this website</a>. Open it up and enter all the relevant details the form asks you to fill in ( name, postal address, Facebook username, email address). Ensure you enter the email address with which you created your Facebook account. The most important thing to know is that the form must be filled out before August 25, 2023. </p>
<h2>How To Claim Facebook Settlement?</h2>
<p>The Internet has been buzzing with queries regarding how to claim Facebook settlement. The simplest way is to click the submit button at the end of the form. There’s another option to submit the form- Download and print it and then send it to the following address.</p>
<blockquote><p>Settlement Administrator</p>

<p>c/o Settlement Administrator</p>
<p>1650 Arch St., Suite 2210</p>

<h2>How can I receive the payment?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-302809" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2.jpg" alt="Claim Facebook Settlement" width="1199" height="674" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2.jpg 1199w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/facebook-2-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px" /></p>
<p>So the main question is how to claim Facebook settlement? Well, you need to select the payment option while filling out the claim form. The options provided in the form include a direct transfer to your bank account, Venmo, Zelle, Paypal and Mastercard. The payment option states that the contact details you enter for payment must match the details shared above. A link at the bottom of payment options will help you select the option to receive compensation through a paper check. </p>
<h2>When can I expect the payment?</h2>
<p>The court hearing is on September 7, 2023. Only after the final hearing on the case and judgment have been made can you expect to get something. Remember that the approval of the settlement wouldn’t imply that you can instantly get payment. Post-ruling appeals can delay the same.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can now apply for your share of a $725 million Facebook data privacy class action settlement payout if you used Facebook in the last 16 years</p>
<p>Facebook users who had an active account between May 2007 and December 2022 can apply for a share of a $725 million settlement</p>
<p>Users…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>How much payment can I expect to get?</h2>
<p>Now you know how to claim Facebook settlement, it is time to look at the payment you might get. See it is difficult to arrive at a definite payment amount. There are many factors that can influence the payment you’ll receive. The first thing is to know the number of Facebook users who will fill out the claim.<br />
The USA has roughly 250 million Facebook users in 2023. And we expect that 60-70% of users can fill out the form.</p>
<p>Then the next factor is the lawyers’ fees. They will get around 25 per cent of legal fees (that comes out to be $181.3 million). This leaves the Facebook settlement amount to be $543.7 million. Ignoring any additional cost, we think an individual will get can be between $6-$10. Please note that this is a rough calculation, and the actual yield can be lower or higher.</p>
<p>Well, you need to wait for some months to know the final decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Martin Scorcese’s 2013 dark comedy <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jonah-hill-did-the-wolf-of-wall-street-for-just-60k-and-heres-why/">“The Wolf of Wall Street”</a> shocked viewers with its raunchy scenes featuring heavy drug use, extreme profanity, and sex. But did you know the film is quite similar to what happened in real life?</p>
<p>The Leonardo Di Caprio starrer is based on the real-life wolf of Wall Street and convicted former stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Belfort’s ex-wife Nadine Macaluso revealed last week in a Tiktok video that a jaw-dropping pool party scene from the movie was based on a real event.</p>
<h3>The Wolf Of Wall Street pool party scene happened in real-life</h3>
<figure id="attachment_302625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-302625" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-302625" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st-1024x576.jpg" alt="the wolf of wall street" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st-150x84.jpg 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-wolf-of-wall-st.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-302625" class="wp-caption-text">The Wolf i=of Wall Street Pool Party Scene happened in real lfe</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the movie,<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/margot-robbie-barbie-film-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Margot Robbie</a> who plays a character inspired by Macaluso goes to a pool party where Jonah Hill’s character, Donnie Azoff, exposes himself to her and masturbates. Hill’s role was based on real-life stockbroker Danny Porush, and while Macaluso won’t confirm who exposed himself to her, she said someone really did.</p>
<p>Macaluso says this in a Tiktok video,</p>
<blockquote><p>“So you guys have been asking, ‘How did you meet Belfort, the wolf of Wall Street?’ Well, it’s actually pretty similar to the movie.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Macaluso further explained,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I was 22 years old and modeling. My boyfriend at the time said, ‘Do you want to go to the party in West Hampton at a house on the beach?’ I was like, ‘Sure,’ &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>The scene in the critically acclaimed flick shows partygoers taking Quaaludes and other drugs to get a buzz, just like in Macaluso’s telling of the story.</p>
<p>The therapist continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We pulled up and I remember walking into the house. There were all these people and they were acting really weird. Little did I know, they were all Quaaluded out, I had no idea. They were all there with their wives, but they were making lewd and weird comments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She added,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I actually got terrified by that. I’m 22 and I said to my boyfriend at the time, ‘We have to leave this party,’ and we left right away.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Nadine Macaluso&#8217;s life today</h3>
<p>Nadine Macaluso&#8217;s life is much different now than when she was 22. The former model now works as a therapist and a family and marriage counselor.</p>
<p>She was the source material for Margot Robbie’s Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese’s 2013 biographical drama. Macaluso often uses her TikTok to educate women on abusive relationships – breaking down topics like gaslighting and trauma bonds – but has shifted focus to give insight into her relationship with the real Jordan Belfort whose memoir was adapted to make the film.</p>

<p>She opened up about what she felt when the film was first released in 2013 in one of her videos saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Can you imagine having a movie made about your life, about your love life that was a Greek tragedy? It’s not fun. If you look at it through Jordan’s lens, it was really accurate. I think that if you look at it through my lens, it wasn’t, and that makes sense because that was actually how our marriage was.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Belfort and Macaluso were married for 14 years before divorcing in 2005, with Malcaluso citing domestic abuse. They have 2 kids together- Carter and Chandler Belfort.</p>
<h3>Macaluso praised Robbie for her acting skills</h3>
