										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who have been married for 12 years, purchased a vineyard and château in southern France in 2008.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt is reportedly suing his ex-wife Angelina Jolie, claiming that she willfully sought to &#8216;inflict harm&#8217; on the reputation of their previously co-owned winery, Miraval, by selling her interests to a stranger.&#8217; According to People, the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star recently filed documents in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Since their divorce over five years ago, the ex-couple has been at war over the wine vineyard.</p>
<h3>Brad Pitt with Angelina Jolie</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-306104 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W.jpg" alt="Brad Pitt accuses ex-wife Angelina Jolie " width="2500" height="1667" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W.jpg 2500w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xBamE5W-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></p>
<p>In 2008, the ex-couple purchased a vineyard and château in the south of France after a 12-year relationship. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith costars were married on the property, together with their six children. However, according to the outlet, Brad Pitt&#8217;s lawyers claim that when Jolie sold her shares to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer owned by Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, she intended to harm the reputation of &#8216;the brand Pitt so carefully built.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to the site, Brad Pitt&#8217;s filings contain a claim that the couple agreed not to sell shares of their co-owned properties without first telling the other party and allege a breach of contract between Pitt&#8217;s firm, Mondo Bongo, and Jolie&#8217;s company, Nouvel. According to the BBC, Jolie did inform Pitt of her &#8216;sad&#8217; choice to sell in January 2021. Brad Pitt also claims in the complaint that Jolie contributed &#8216;nothing to [Château] Miraval&#8217;s success.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Pitt was the one who converted the winery &#8216;into a multimillion-dollar global corporation and one of the world&#8217;s most highly acclaimed manufacturers of rosé wine.&#8217; Pitt requests that damages be determined at a jury trial and that the sale be declared null and void because he thinks Shefler&#8217;s presence in the former couple&#8217;s wine business will degrade his work.</p>

<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a source told the outlet, “Mr Pitt’s lawsuit against Ms <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/amber-heard-wishes-career-like-angelina-jolie/">Jolie</a> is an extension of a false narrative, and the truth of the situation has still not been made public. After the events that led to Ms Jolie filing for divorce and her years devoted to caring for their children, Ms Jolie and the children have not been able to return to the property, and she made the difficult decision to sell her stake in the business.”</p>
<p>The source went on to say, “After making multiple offers to her ex-husband, and knowing the business will be inherited by their children, she found a business partner with experience in the alcohol industry.” The source adds, “It’s unfortunate that after she properly and legally exited the business, Mr Pitt is entangling her in multiple lawsuits.”</p></blockquote>

<p>D.A.R.E which was established in the 1980s during the Ronald Reagan-era “war on drugs,” advocates for a zero-tolerance policy on drugs. The organization said in a statement against the show,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rather than further each parent’s desire to keep their children safe from the potentially horrific consequences of drug abuse and other high-risk behavior, HBO’s television drama, &#8216;Euphoria,&#8217; chooses to misguidedly glorify and erroneously depict high school student drug use, addiction, anonymous sex, violence, and other destructive behaviors as common and widespread in today’s world,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>D.A.R.E added it would like to consult with representatives of the show to present its concerns.</p>
<p>The statement further reads,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is unfortunate that HBO, social media, television program reviewers, and paid advertising have chosen to refer to the show as &#8216;groundbreaking,&#8217; rather than recognizing the potential negative consequences on school age children who today face unparalleled risks and mental health challenges,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Zendaya responds to critics</h3>

<p>A month after the statement from D.A.R.E and growing criticism against the show, Zendaya responded.</p>
<p>Now, the actress, who happens to be an executive producer on the series, posted a statement on social media warning viewers that the show could be triggering to some and emphasizing that it is for mature audiences.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know I’ve said this before, but I do want to reiterate to everyone that Euphoria is for mature audiences. This season, maybe even more so than the last, is deeply emotional and deals with subject matter that can be triggering and difficult to watch,”</p></blockquote>
<p>She added that viewers should &#8220;only watch it if you feel comfortable.”</p>
<p>Zendaya posted a similar warning before the show&#8217;s debut in 2019 saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just a reminder before tonight’s premiere, that Euphoria is for mature audiences. It’s a raw and honest portrait of addiction, anxiety, and the difficulties of navigating life today. There are scenes that are graphic, hard to watch, and can be triggering. Please only watch if you feel you can handle it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The show also makes it a point to run a disclaimer about mental health with a phone number for the National Alliance of Mental Health runs ahead of episodes dealing with mental health issues.</p>

<p>While HBO did not respond to critics, Zendaya told Entertainment Weekly that people should not be modeling their lives after Rue. She stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our show is in no way a moral tale to teach people how to live their life or what they should be doing. If anything, the feeling behind Euphoria, or whatever we have always been trying to do with it, is to hopefully help people feel a little bit less alone in their experience and their pain. And maybe feel like they&#8217;re not the only one going through or dealing with what they&#8217;re dealing with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts? Does Euphoria promote addiction and drug use or is it helping today&#8217;s youth cope with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety? Let us know in the comments. Don&#8217;t forget to follow hiptoro for the latest celebrity news and gossip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bam Margera posted a new video in which he says some mean things about his family. But, as this is reported, Lamar Odom offered Bam Margera a free stay at one of his addiction treatment centers. Bam Margera says he heard about Lamar&#8217;s offer and will take him up on it.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://share.tmz.com/watch/2023-04-28-042823-bam-margera-1606653-609/" width="560" height="395" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bam Margera says he&#8217;s given up drinking because of some scary things that happened in his personal life.</h2>
<p>He also says he tested negative for m*th after his brother said he was hooked on the dangerous drug.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/bam-margera-drug-test-negative-drinking/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md/" rel="attachment wp-att-312026"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312026" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md.jpg" alt="Bam Margera" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md.jpg 728w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>Bam Margera put out a series of statements Friday, first saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>Well my brother made false accusations of me being on m*th. But when I wear to god and Phoenix the wolfs life I’m not, I went with my lawyers to urgent care. Guess what Jesse margera. The results are negative. Now you will be evicted from castlebam sooner than later. Get your f***in s*** out HOMOner. Oh wait… not no more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jess said that Bam was on m*th and hallucinating earlier this week when he was still on the run from the police. This really got under Bam&#8217;s skin, and he hasn&#8217;t stopped talking about it since. Bam denied these claims and told Jess that he would sue him for slander and kick him out of his house.</p>

<p>Bam also says he&#8217;s done drinking for the sake of his son, Phoenix.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been through official termoil with my family.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also thanked his current girlfriend, Jessica, for being there for him during his recent problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>For once I am not dating a hot dog strutting floozy.</p></blockquote>
<p>He praised Jessica for helping him hire Michael van der Veen as an attorney to help him with his ongoing case with his brother.</p>
<p>Finally, Bam takes a shot at his ex-wife, Missy Margera, whom he thinks tried to help the police find him while he was on the run last week.</p>
<p>As reported, Bam turned himself in to the police on Thursday. He had been on the run for four days after his brother told the police that Bam beat him up and threatened to kill him.</p>

<h3>Has Somebody Somewhere Been Renewed or Canceled?</h3>
<p>As of 30th April, 2023, HBO has not made any official announcement whether the show will be renewed for season 3 or canceled. But by looking at the ratings of season 2, we can expect another season in the series.</p>
<p>Season 2 had taken a massive jump from season 1 in terms of ratings. A total of 50% viewership of the show has been increased in season 2. This is a good indicator that the show might get renewed for season 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How to watch &#8216;Suzume&#8217;? &#8211;</strong> Makoto Shinkai gained worldwide recognition after his 2016 anime movie &#8216;Your Name&#8217; became a mega-hit. Prior to this, anime movies were mostly associated with the gentle beauty of Studio Ghibli. But &#8216;Your Name&#8217; not only showcased Shinkai&#8217;s breathtaking visuals and incredibly detailed storytelling but also made everyone aware that his future projects were a must-see.</p>
<p>After the success of ‘Your Name,’ Makoto Shinkai&#8217;s 2019 project ‘Weathering With You’ didn&#8217;t quite live up to the hype but still showcased his remarkable storytelling skills. Now, with his latest film <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzume no Tojimari</a>, Shinkai promises yet another exciting and emotionally engaging adventure.</p>

<p>In Shinkai&#8217;s latest film, Suzume, a 17-year-old girl encounters a mysterious young man who speaks of a door in her quiet town of Kyushu. She soon discovers a weathered door standing tall among ruins, and as she reaches for the knob, doors begin to open all across Japan, causing destruction and chaos. She discovers that she possesses a unique ability to close these portals and prevent further devastation. The film features stunning visuals of the stars, sunsets, and morning sky that guide Suzume on her perilous journey to close the doors and save Japan.</p>
<p>The movie has been well-received by both critics and audiences alike. It&#8217;s a captivating story of adventure and self-discovery, with reviewers praising its dazzling visuals and emotional depth.</p>

<h3>How to watch &#8216;Suzume&#8217; Online?</h3>
<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s no news of the new hit movie being available for streaming anywhere. The distributors have chosen to have an exclusive theatrical release, given Shinkai&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a slight chance that the movie may be released on Crunchyroll in a few months. Although there&#8217;s no confirmation yet, considering that Crunchyroll previously released Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero in theaters and on their website, we may expect the same and expect it to release by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on this space for further updates as we receive more information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nick Cannon seems pretty happy that &#8220;<strong>Red Table Talk</strong>,&#8221; Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s talk show is over. at least for now.</p>
<p>During a segment of his new live radio show, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amp-live-radio-music-talk/id1586403838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Daily Cannon</a>, the 42-year-old host was honest about how he felt about the show being canceled and Will Smith&#8217;s many roles over the years.</p>
<p>Meta said on Thursday that they would be shutting down Facebook Watch. This means that the popular talk show will no longer be available. Nick Cannon said that the new development was &#8220;good,&#8221; and then he said that Jada and Will&#8217;s public talk about their marriage on RTT led to the &#8220;King Richard&#8221; actor&#8217;s famous outburst at the 2022 Oscars.</p>

<blockquote><p>If there was no Red Table Talk, then he wouldn&#8217;t have slapped the s&#8212; out of Chris Rock,</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;Wild N&#8217; Out&#8221; alum was referring to the &#8220;slap heard &#8217;round the world&#8221; after Rock made a joke about Jada&#8217;s shaved head during the ceremony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Even though Nick Cannon&#8217;s co-hosts Courtney Bee Bledsoe and Abby De La Rosa said how much they liked the show, Cannon called it the &#8220;toxic table.&#8221;</h2>
<blockquote><p>That was royalty, Will and Jada. Then they brought it to the table,&#8221; he said of Smith&#8217;s frequent appearances on the program. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know all this s&#8212; about y&#8217;all.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most famous sit-down interviews with the &#8220;<strong>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</strong>&#8221; star was in 2020, when he and his wife talked about private parts of their marriage and Pinkett-Smith&#8217;s &#8220;romantic entanglement&#8221; with August Alsina, a friend of their son Jaden Smith. Even though the two said they were no longer together at the time, the interview still went viral online.</p>

<p>Three generations of the Smith family, including Jada&#8217;s daughter Willow Smith and her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris, cohosted her show. They talked about hot topics around the table, which was the name of the show. After Meta&#8217;s announcement, the show said they were &#8220;in talks of finding a new home&#8221; and told fans,</p>

<p>Sweet Tooth season 3 could be a possibility as fans are eagerly waiting for more after the second season&#8217;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15137444/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">epic ending</a>. In the second season, the story saw <em>Gus</em> and other hybrids captured and imprisoned by <em>General Abbot</em> and his mercenaries. <em>Jepperd</em> and <em>Aimee</em> team up to save them while <em>Dr. Singh</em> works to find a cure for the virus. With so many plot threads left hanging, fans are speculating and hoping for a third season to wrap everything up. However, there hasn&#8217;t been an official announcement about the renewal yet.</p>

<h2>Is Sweet Tooth season 3 happening?</h2>
<p>As of April 27, Netflix has not renewed Sweet Tooth for a third season, and while some shows are given early renewals, Sweet Tooth was not one of them. However, fans should worry yet, as the streaming platform does not always renew shows early.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-306362" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-1024x464.webp" alt="Sweet Tooth season 3: Will there be a third season on Netflix?" width="1024" height="464" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-1024x464.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-300x136.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-768x348.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-1536x696.webp 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-2048x928.webp 2048w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-1600x725.webp 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sweet-tooth-season-3-renewal-status-150x68.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s possible that we&#8217;ll have to wait for about a month before we hear any official word from Netflix about a Sweet Tooth season 3. The streaming giant needs to evaluate the show&#8217;s viewership numbers during the first month after release to determine its success. High viewing hours during this time could increase the likelihood of renewal. However, completion rates are also significant; viewers must watch all eight episodes of the second season for it to count.</p>
<p>With how the second season ended, a third season of Sweet Tooth is possible. But we&#8217;re waiting for Netflix&#8217;s approval. There&#8217;s still more story to tell.</p>
<p>Spread the word about Sweet Tooth season 2 while we wait for news on a potential season 3. Letting more people know about the show can increase the likelihood of its renewal. We&#8217;ll keep you posted when there&#8217;s an update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Holland and Zendaya are currently the most talked about couple in Hollywood right now. After winning the heart of Zendaya’s family, it now looks like the Spider-Man star has won the heart of Zendaya&#8217;s on-screen mom, Nika King.</p>
<h3>Nika King is a fan of Tom</h3>
<p>Nika, 44, plays Leslie Bennett to Zendaya’s troubled drug addict Rue in HBO’s shock teen drama Euphoria. She revealed that she became a fan of the Spider-Man star after she met him at her co-star’s house.</p>
<p>King told Page Six,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve met Tom. He’s come over to her house when they have dinners and stuff like that. He’s very sweet, very nice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She clarified she didn&#8217;t know the extent of the couple&#8217;s relationship saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And I don’t know what the extent of their relationship [is] but they always look happy, they always look like they’re enjoying themselves. And I’m just like, look, whenever I see love, I’m here for it.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>King talks about Zendaya</h3>
<figure id="attachment_303554" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303554" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-303554" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1.jpg" alt="nika king" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1.jpg 2400w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-1536x806.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-2048x1075.jpg 2048w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-1600x840.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tomdaya-1-150x79.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-303554" class="wp-caption-text">Tomdaya have been dating for several years now</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tom Holland and Sendaya have been together since 2017 when they co-starred in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” him as the titular hero and her in the role of his love interest, Michelle Jones-Watson, aka MJ.</p>
<p>King believes Holland is among Zendaya’s “good core of people.&#8221; According to her this helps keep the former Disney star grounded despite her insurmountable fame.</p>
<p>Nika King explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;She has a good core of people around her and I think that’s also important. She keeps her clique pretty small.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So she’s learned through probably the same — just like we all do — trial and error, or having different people come into your life just to say, ‘OK, this is the tribe and I trust this tribe.’”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Nika King reflects on her own journey in Hollywood</h3>
<p>Observing <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/zendayas-last-minute-coachella-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendaya’s</a> star rise over the years has provided King an opportunity to reflect on her own journey in Hollywood. Though she’s been steadily working for decades — as an actress, model and comedian — the multi-hyphenate is grateful to have achieved her celebrity later in life.</p>
<p>King says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’m glad it took as long as it did because if I would have gotten success early, I’m pretty sure I would’ve been somewhere strung out on drugs because it’ll suck you in if you don’t have a strong core or a foundation of who you are,”</p></blockquote>
<p>She continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No one can tell me who I am because I’ve had so many years to kind of go through the, ‘Oh, my hair isn’t straight enough, oh, my nose is not [thin] enough, oh, my complexion, I need to be more ambiguous.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>King proudly shares that she&#8217;s happy the way she is and is no longer searching for anyone’s validation.</p>
<p>King says she doesn&#8217;t care for the criticism she sustained in the early days of her career, oftentimes rooted in misogyny and racism. She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;All of those things don’t affect me now because I’ve been through those things. I feel so much stronger and confident today because of it.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Nika King is a philanthropist</h3>

<p>Nika King&#8217;s self-worth is bolstered by her philanthropic efforts. Last year, she launched Rose of Sharon, a nonprofit inspired by her mother’s battles with addiction, cancer and mental health to benefit those in the black community experiencing similar struggles.</p>

King said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are stigmas in our community surrounding all of these issues that I want to help erase. I love my people.”</p></blockquote>
