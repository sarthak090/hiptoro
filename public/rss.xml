										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s situation has taken over the internet and social media sites. It has also become the talk of the town, especially after Will Smith&#8217;s antics at the 94th Academy Awards. Both of them were open about their marriage, and the fact that Jada Pinkett Smith admitted to having an affair with someone else has become a big deal.</p>
<p>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith are both great actors who have made many blockbusters and big-money movies when they were at their best. Will Smith is one of the most famous actors of all time and one of the richest people in Hollywood. Pinkett Smith, on the other hand, is one of the 100 most powerful people in the world in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Red Table Talk</strong>, Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s talk show, was recently canceled by Facebook, and fans took to social media right away to talk about it.</p>

<h2>Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table TalkCanceled By Facebook.</h2>
<p>Jada Pinkett Smith is a pretty big name in Hollywood. She has made her name in the business by starring in several blockbuster movies and franchises, most notably <strong>The Matrix</strong> franchise. During her time in Hollywood, she has worked with many well-known actors and actresses. This helped her build a name for herself in the business, and it wasn&#8217;t long before she became well-known. Her talk show, <strong>Red Table Talk</strong>, which was hosted by Facebook Watch, was one of the best ways for her fans and followers all over the world to be entertained. It also gave famous Hollywood stars like Demi Moore, Sandra Bullock, Kelly Osbourne, and Ireland Baldwin a chance to appear on the show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk-fb/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled/" rel="attachment wp-att-308282"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308282" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/221214114112-will-smith-red-table-talk-121422-scaled-1-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The show&#8217;s cancellation came as a surprise, but it wasn&#8217;t too much of a surprise since it was the last Facebook Original show. Facebook has stopped making shows and is now focusing on VR experiences. Even though there have been reports that the team is looking for a platform for their show, nothing has changed in this area.</p>
<p>In recent years, <strong>Red Table Talk</strong> has played an important role by bringing famous people to the show and solving a lot of mysteries. The show, which is run by Jada Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow Smith, and her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris, has been a lot of fun lately, especially after what happened with Will Smith and Chris Rock, but alas!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s Situation.</h2>
<p>There are always bumps in Hollywood relationships, and some don&#8217;t just have small bumps; their whole relationship is a bump. This was the case with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, who have been together for 25 years. They were in a bad situation, but not in the same way as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Because of their fame, the situation was more tense than it should have been, and the constant jokes and rumors about their marriage made it even worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk-fb/image-2-94/" rel="attachment wp-att-308281"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308281" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="1066" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2.jpeg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2-150x100.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Will Smith was banned from the Academy Awards for a whole decade because of the controversy at the Oscars. This was something that had never happened before. As usual, the issue blew up on social media. Some people said it was romantic that Smith stood up for his wife without thinking twice, while others said he was crazy and expected him to take the high road because of his power and influence in the industry. After the short fight between actor Will Smith and comedian Chris Rock, officials wanted to help the actor leave the event, but they were told otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk-fb/august-alsina-and-jada-pinkett-smith/" rel="attachment wp-att-308280"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308280" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/August-Alsina-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith.jpg" alt="August Alsina and Jada Pinkett Smith" width="611" height="335" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/August-Alsina-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith.jpg 611w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/August-Alsina-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-300x164.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/August-Alsina-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-150x82.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Both Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have been accused of cheating by each other, and every time their story made it to social media, it was turned into a typical drama. There were rumors that Will Smith had an affair with Margot Robbie, a popular actress in Hollywood. However, both Will Smith and Margot Robbie denied the rumors right away. August Alsina and Jada Pinkett Smith had a relationship that was kept secret until it could no longer be hidden. Alsina was a friend of her son, Jaden Smith. She met Alsina in 2015 at the London Music Festival.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of two illegal streaming sites was fined $30 million by a group of the biggest movie and TV studios.</p>
<p>According to court documents filed on March 27, the studios and defendant Dwayne Johnson (no relation to the actor) reached a deal to end the lawsuit. The deal includes an injunction that prevents him from continuing to run any service that lets users steal movies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In December 2021, Universal, Disney, and Netflix all sued Johnson for stealing their ideas. Others, like Universal, Warner Bros., Paramount, and Apple, also joined the lawsuit.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/disney-and-other-major-studios-get-30-million-from-illegal-streaming-sites-amid-piracy-crackdown/disney-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-307874"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307874" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney.jpg" alt="Disney" width="900" height="900" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney.jpg 900w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney-300x300.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney-768x768.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Disney-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The amount of piracy was &#8220;massive,&#8221; the complaint says. Johnson ran two services, AllAccessTV (AATV) and Quality Restreams, that sold subscriptions to copyrighted movies and TV shows, like <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, <strong>Jurassic Park</strong>, and <strong>The Office</strong>, through thousands of live channels and video-on-demand options. Users could watch major networks like HBO, Cinemax, and NBC through the live channel feed. Customers could put the platforms on their devices by downloading them.</p>
<p>The settlement comes at a time when studios and production companies are taking more and more people to court for violating their copyright by streaming content illegally. In September, Voltage Pictures and other owners of copyrights settled three lawsuits against internet service providers for not kicking out customers who pirated their movies over and over again. Copyright law is what intellectual property owners use most to fight illegal streaming.</p>
<p>Access to VOD was included in subscription plans for an extra $15 per month on top of the $25 base plan. It put content into many different categories, one of which was the streaming service where the movie or TV show was shown.</p>
<p>The suit said that Johnson knew what he was doing was wrong. It said that he was trying to hide his illegal business by using a website that looks like it sells VPN software but really sells subscriptions to his services. If copyright is broken on purpose, the owner can get statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work that was stolen.</p>
<p>The complaint says that Johnson made $3 million a year from AATV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are few guarantees in life like a box office hit for a Johnny Depp-led Pirates of the Caribbean film. Fans have laughed and bought tickets for Depp&#8217;s various portrayals of Jack Sparrow, with each film generating a lot of money at the box office. But did you know Johnny Depp was almost dismissed from the first film in the series by Disney? Johnny Depp later stated that it would have been for a rather embarrassing cause.</p>
<h3>Johnny Depp’s brilliant acting career</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-305516 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ff38OLW.png" alt="Johnny Depp" width="858" height="630" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ff38OLW.png 858w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ff38OLW-300x220.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ff38OLW-768x564.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ff38OLW-150x110.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></p>
<p>For nearly 30 years, Johnny Depp has been one of Hollywood&#8217;s most famous and sought-after actors. Depp is well-known for his chameleon-like ability to adapt himself to various roles. Early in his career, he appeared in the drama What&#8217;s Eating Gilbert Grape, but he is best known for playing the eccentric lead role in Edward Scissorhands. Since then, he&#8217;s portrayed nearly every type of character imaginable, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The eccentric Willy Wonka</li>
<li>The Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland</li>
<li>Mobster Whitey Bulger</li>
<li>The drug dealer George Jung</li>
<li>The voice of a cartoon lizard in Rango</li>
<li>The evil wizard Grindelwald in the Harry Potter universe</li>
</ul>
<p>It is apparent that Johnny Depp has a wide range. He&#8217;s played an exceptionally diverse range of characters. Depp has also starred in several successful blockbusters and franchises. None of the franchises has done as well as Pirates of the Caribbean.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnnydepp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305517" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k.jpg" alt="Johnny Depp" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k.jpg 1200w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k-300x300.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k-768x768.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mf9Hg9k-96x96.jpg 96w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<h3>How Johnny Depp made ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ a worldwide phenomenon</h3>
<p>Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. Based on Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Sparrow is a hard-drinking, scatterbrained pirate with a strong moral compass. Sparrow&#8217;s experiences bring him into contact with a wide range of good and bad personalities.</p>
<p>Many characters appear to have a history with Sparrow, as they are frequently unhappy to see him again. Depp plays Sparrow with a physicality reminiscent of Buster Keaton. He also has the mischievous spirit of Bugs Bunny in him. All of this adds up to Sparrow being one of the most memorable characters from a recent movie trilogy.</p>
<p>The Pirates&#8217; flicks have all been enormous box-office successes. According to Box Office Mojo, none of the five films in the series have earned less than $172 million. The highest-grossing film in the franchise was Dead Man&#8217;s Chest, which grossed $423 million.</p>
<p>While the films are full of colorful characters, exciting action, and brilliantly filmed set pieces, there is no doubt about who drives their success. People keep coming back to see Depp&#8217;s Sparrow.</p>
<h3>The time Johnny Depp was nearly fired from ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’</h3>
<p><iframe title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Johnny Depp &quot;Jack Sparrow&quot; Exclusive Interview Part 1 of 2 | ScreenSlam" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdK4GwHQkMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s difficult to imagine anyone other than Depp in the role of Captain Jack, Disney executives almost fired him. Before the film was released, some Disney executives were concerned about Depp&#8217;s portrayal of <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/johnny-depp-surprises-a-young-fan-in-hospital-and-makes-his-dream-come-true-dressing-up-as-captain-jack-sparrow/">Jack Sparrow.</a></p>
<p>Michael Eisner, then-CEO of Disney, was particularly perplexed. In an online interview, Depp revealed that he was almost fired for making the role too &#8220;<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/noah-schnapps-stranger-things-come-out-as-gay/">gay</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Yeah, they wanted to fire me…It trickled back to me that [former Disney CEO] Michael Eisner went on some sort of bent about how ‘G*dd*mnit Johnny Depp’s ruining the film! Is it drunk? Is it gay?’ So I fully expected to be fired.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnny Depp embraced the criticism, assuring the studio executives that all of his characters were gay. Of course, he wasn&#8217;t fired, and both Disney and Depp profited handsomely. It just goes to show that Hollywood executives who consider themselves to be creative should probably leave filmmaking to the artists. What&#8217;s wrong with Captain Sparrow being gay?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their own motives for choosing a profession, but some are stranger than others. Will Smith, one of the world&#8217;s most bankable actors, had an unusual motivation for becoming an actor.</p>
<p>Smith was apparently inspired to become famous after his first lover cheated on him. And, while it&#8217;s hardly the healthiest motive to want success, it&#8217;s worked for Smith.</p>
<h3>Will Smith is one of the biggest actors in the world.</h3>

<p>Smith is one of the most successful actors in film history. He has a net worth of approximately $350 million after appearing in hit films such as Men in Black, Independence Day, and Alladin. According to Forbes, his films have grossed over $3.5 billion in total, with Alladin alone grossing over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Every summer in the 2000s, it was difficult not to see Smith&#8217;s face in a blockbuster picture. Although he dazzled audiences with more mainstream films early in his career, he shifted his focus to deeper, more complex roles as his career progressed. Films like Seven Pounds, The Pursuit of Happiness, and Concussion showcased Smith&#8217;s versatility as an actor.</p>
<p>Smith reprises his role as Mike Lowry, a Miami police officer, opposite Martin Lawrence in his most recent picture, Bad Boys for Life. According to Box Office Mojo, Smith&#8217;s latest film, Bad Boys for Life, grossed over $426 million.</p>
<h3>Will Smith’s cheating ex-girlfriend inspired him to become a famous actor</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-303192 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-scaled.jpg" alt="Will Smith" width="1763" height="2560" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-scaled.jpg 1763w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-207x300.jpg 207w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-705x1024.jpg 705w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-768x1115.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-1058x1536.jpg 1058w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-1410x2048.jpg 1410w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-1600x2323.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3Bk0eQq-150x218.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1763px) 100vw, 1763px" /></p>
<p>While many actors claim to have chosen their profession because they enjoy the craft, Smith had a different motivation. In a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said that his passion for acting stemmed from adolescent heartbreak.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I was 15 years old, my first girlfriend cheated on me,” Smith said. “And I remember making a decision that nobody would ever cheat on me again. And the way I was gonna do that was by being the biggest actor on Earth.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-303191 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sehMbmi.jpg" alt="Will Smith" width="750" height="1082" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sehMbmi.jpg 750w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sehMbmi-208x300.jpg 208w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sehMbmi-710x1024.jpg 710w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sehMbmi-150x216.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Smith knows that his motives and reasoning for becoming an actor are illogical. In reality, his feelings are more about relying on success to validate himself than about his ex-girlfriend.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So, there’s been this weird psychology that I’ve always felt, like, if my movies are number one, my life is gonna work out great.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Will Smith is happily married today.</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that an unfaithful girlfriend helped launch his career, Smith has already moved on. He is now married to Jada Pinkett-Smith, whom he has been married to since 1997. Jaden and Willow Smith, the couple&#8217;s children, are also actors and musicians.</p>

<p>In 1998, he met his wife, Jessica. Before that, he was in a with Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, a 17-year-old high school senior, in a relationship that caused a lot of trouble. Jerry Seinfeld was 21 years older than her when they met in Central Park in New York City in May 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><b>Jerry Seinfeld on Dating a 21-Year Younger Woman.</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jerry-seinfeld-shoshanna-relationship/attachment/856963/" rel="attachment wp-att-307255"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-307255" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/856963.jpg" alt="Jerry Seinfeld and Shoshanna Lonstein" width="841" height="412" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/856963.jpg 700w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/856963-300x147.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/856963-150x74.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like the age difference between them didn&#8217;t bother them.</p>
<blockquote><p>I met this girl, Shoshanna,</p></blockquote>
<p>the comedian told Playboy in a 1993 interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>She’s a very sweet girl and she’s very pretty. I didn’t know how old she was — I knew she wasn’t 40,</p></blockquote>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld revealed.</p>
<blockquote><p>I took her to a basketball game and that was the whole thing,</p></blockquote>
<p>he added.</p>
<p>Jerry Seinfeld&#8217;s relationship with a teenager drew a lot of attention. Howard Stern, who is known for his talk show, <strong>The Howard Stern Show</strong>, asked the comedian some rude questions about their relationship.</p>
<blockquote><p>So you sit in Central Park and have a candy bar on a string and pull it when the girls come?</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Stern, Seinfeld said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t realize she was so young. This is the only girl I ever went out with who was that young. I wasn’t dating her. We just went to a restaurant, and that was it.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jerry-seinfeld-shoshanna-relationship/shoshanna-lonstein-and-jerry-seinfeld/" rel="attachment wp-att-307254"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307254" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld.jpg" alt="Jerry Seinfeld and Shoshanna Lonstein" width="1200" height="806" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld.jpg 1200w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld-300x202.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld-768x516.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld-760x510.jpg 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shoshanna-Lonstein-and-Jerry-Seinfeld-150x101.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>Seinfeld was always quick to defend his controversial relationship with Gruss.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not an idiot,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said defending the relationship.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shoshanna is a person, not an age. She is extremely bright. She’s funny, sharp, very alert. We just get along. You can hear the click.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, reports said that the couple first said they were &#8220;just friends&#8221; and didn&#8217;t tell anyone about their relationship until Gruss turned 18.</p>
<p>George Wallace, a comedian and close friend of Seinfeld, told People that she was beautiful and mature and that &#8220;she&#8217;s good for him.&#8221; Seinfeld’s manager at the time, George Shapiro also said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never seen him happier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, Jerry Seinfeld told Playboy,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t meet that many women I like, period. So when I like someone, I don’t care about her race, creed, or national origin. If I like her, I don’t care. I don’t discriminate. If she’s 18, if she’s intelligent, that’s fine.</p></blockquote>
<p>After dating for four years, the couple broke up in 1997. According to the news, there was no fight between the two. Gruss went to UCLA, and as Seinfeld worked more and more in Los Angeles, the distance between them grew. In the end, her lifestyle couldn&#8217;t keep up with the comedian&#8217;s busy schedule.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to run around and play,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>Gruss said that she was happy with the relationship, but it didn&#8217;t work out because they lived far apart.</p>

<p>After they broke up, Gruss got a job as a fashion designer. She then came up with the idea of &#8220;clothes with more inclusivity&#8221; for her first collection, which came out in 1998 under her own name. In 2003, she married Joshua Gruss, who ran a record label. They have a daughter named Sienna and twin boys named Joseph and Angelica. 2014 was also the year that the Gruss couple broke up. It was &#8220;amicable and sad.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrote on Instagram in 2021 that she was writing a book about her life called &#8220;<strong>The Fabric of My Life</strong>.&#8221; Now, she is busy with her business and social media, where she often posts photos of her children and items from her collection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jennifer&#8217;s Body, directed by Megan Fox, is a remarkable film for everyone involved. Although the film was not a box office hit upon its initial release, the cast and crew continued to promote it for years. Jennifer&#8217;s Body eventually gained a cult following due to its timely issues, characterizations, and performances from those involved.</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s two stars, Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, have both praised it. And, while they both claim to have had a fantastic time filming the picture, the couple felt one scene to be too disturbing even for a horror film. And it meant the two actors had to kiss.</p>
<h3>Megan Fox is proud that Jennifer’s Body was able to influence the LGBT community.</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302797" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bCSuQUj.jpg" alt="Megan Fox" width="735" height="395" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bCSuQUj.jpg 735w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bCSuQUj-300x161.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bCSuQUj-150x81.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<p>The film&#8217;s current spike in popularity has had the extra benefit of making young girls feel more at ease with their s*xuality. Jennifer&#8217;s body appears to be a horror flick. After a demon takes possession of a popular cheerleader&#8217;s body, she begins feasting on men&#8217;s bodies. But there&#8217;s a love story beneath the surface involving Megan Fox &#8216;s character, Jennifer, and her nerdy best friend, played by Amanda Seyfried.</p>
<p>Megan Fox claims the romance plotline of Fox and Seyfried has inspired many young females.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can’t tell you how many girls, from 30 down into their teens – or, f*** that, my age, too – come up to me and are like, ‘I realized I was gay because of you,’ or ‘I felt comfortable coming out because of you,’” Megan Fox revealed according to Dazed. “Because of Jennifer’s Body and the interviews I did about being bis*xual before it was cool.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302801" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Y2PMcBv.jpg" alt="Megan Fox" width="540" height="300" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Y2PMcBv.jpg 540w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Y2PMcBv-300x167.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Y2PMcBv-150x83.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Fox expressed her gratitude for such moments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s something that’s so important to me, that I’m so proud of,” Fox said. “If my purpose on Earth was to help one girl come out the closet and feel OK about it, I had an amazing purpose here.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Fox and Seyfried struggled to portray that kind of love on TV. When it came time to kiss, both performers stated that the experience terrified them.</p>
<h3>Megan Fox once revealed that she was horrified she had to kiss Amanda Seyfried in ‘Jennifer’s Body’</h3>
<p><iframe title="Megan Fox Talks ‘Jennifer’s Body’, Jokes With Johnny Simmons | EXTENDED" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-bfAHWU_I4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In an interview with Variety, Fox admitted that the thought of them kissing in the film made her and Seyfried uncomfortable.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I remember Amanda and I were horrified that we had to make out,” Fox said. “Her more so than me. I was slightly more comfortable being able to do it. She was not excited about having to film that scene at all.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Many things, according to Fox, made it difficult for the two stars to kiss.</p>

<blockquote><p>“I remember we were both stressed out because we had chin acne and there was gonna be this mirror close-up of us kissing. [I remember thinking] ‘They have to paint that out!’ I don’t even know if they did, but that was a very stressful scene for the two of us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Megan Fox&#8217;s co-star, Amanda Seyfried, was pleased with the scene and felt they both pulled it off.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I watch the scene, it’s actually really s*xy,” Seyfried said in an interview with W magazine. “We got it done for the masses, but sadly, the masses didn’t show up.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>How Megan Fox’s Experience with ‘Jennifer’s Body&#8217; was a Prologue to the #MeToo Movement</h3>
<p>Megan Fox admitted to having a mental breakdown after filming Jennifer&#8217;s Body. The <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/bumblebee-restores-the-nostalgia-of-the-transformers-franchise/">Transformers</a> actress stated that the film&#8217;s marketing hypers*xualized her, causing her to feel overwhelmed by the attention.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t want to be seen,” Fox told Entertainment Tonight (via Buzzfeed). “I didn’t want to be seen in public at all.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This resulted in Fox having a #<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/metoo-movement-8-women-accuse-max-landis-of-sexual-abuse-bright-movie-producer/">MeToo</a> moment before the movement was even a thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I feel like I was sort of out and in front of the MeToo movement before the MeToo movement happened,” Fox said. “I was speaking and saying, ‘Hey, these things are happening to me and they’re not OK.’”</p></blockquote>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/megan-fox-terrified-kiss-amanda-seyfried/">Megan Fox previously stated that she was terrified about having to kiss Amanda Seyfried in &#8216;Jennifer&#8217;s Body&#8217;</a></p>
