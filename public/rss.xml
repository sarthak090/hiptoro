										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mila Kunis may be cast as The Thing in the upcoming &#8220;Fantastic 4&#8221; film if you believe a rumor spreading on Twitter this morning.</p>
<p>When a Hollywood insider named @MyTimeToShineH stated Mila was in talks to play a female version of Ben Grimm, the bird app went into a frenzy. The insider is known for gaining scoops before trade newspapers and generally being in the know on superhero news.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">They are looking at Jewish actors, both male AND female for The Thing in Fantastic Four. Mila Kunis is one of them</p>
<p>&mdash; MyTimeToShineHello (@MyTimeToShineH) <a href="https://twitter.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1652062914910601216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the comics, Grimm is the name of the guy that transforms into The Thing&#8230; a big orange rock figure who fights crime alongside Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312366" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5a0097c57f986543008b4602.webp" alt="Mila Kunis" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5a0097c57f986543008b4602.webp 600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5a0097c57f986543008b4602-300x225.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5a0097c57f986543008b4602-150x113.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>MTTSH writes, &#8220;They are looking at Jewish actors, both male AND female for The Thing in Fantastic Four. Mila Kunis is one of them.&#8221; They added that the director of the upcoming 2025 flick, Matt Shakman, insisted Grimm be portrayed be a real-life Jewish actor &#8230; as the character is explicitly depicted as Jewish in the comic books, albeit in later iterations.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="The Thing Saves   Bridge Scene ¦ Fantastic Four 2005 Movie Clip" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wd3RE3dtQ0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Thing is a male character&#8230; and has always been portrayed as such. Whether it was Chuck McCann in the 1990s cartoon, Michael Chiklis in the 2000s film, or Jamie Bell in the 2010s iteration, The Thing has always been portrayed as a man.</p>
<p>However, based on this report – or, more accurately, gossip – it appears that Marvel is considering a gender swap&#8230; or, at the very least, considering it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fant4stic - Coming up with a team name" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3Eb0lfjyv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As you may expect, Twitter users are mostly dissatisfied with the news. The jokes are flying, and the general conclusion appears to be that if Kevin Feige and company continue down this path, many fans will abandon the studio&#8230; as they regard it as going too far.</p>
<h3>Mila Kunis</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Eb0lfjyv0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-312369 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hT0RZN9.png" alt="Mila Kunis" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hT0RZN9.png 728w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hT0RZN9-300x225.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hT0RZN9-150x113.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t the first time a woman has taken on a traditionally male role; it happened in &#8220;<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/new-ghostbusters-movie-the-first-teaser-trailer-is-out/">Ghostbusters</a>&#8221; and, more recently, &#8220;<a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/ryan-coogler-is-creating-x-files-series/">Black Panther 2</a>&#8221; and &#8220;She-Hulk,&#8221; among other films. The point is&#8230; it&#8217;s been done before, and sometimes successfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BRB, I&#8217;m going to tattoo &#8220;Gender is whatever&#8221; over my chest. When questioned about the genders she is attracted to, Ava Phillippe said in an Instagram Story. And, no, we couldn&#8217;t support Ava Phillippe&#8217;s views on gender and s*xuality any longer.</p>
<blockquote><p>For context, Ava Phillippe— the daughter of actors Ryan Philippe and Reese Witherspoon (who’s basically her doppelgänger) — was doing an Instagram Q&amp;A on Jan. 12, 2022 when someone posed the question, “[Do] you like boys or girls?” In response, the 22-year-old shared a selfie — sporting bright blue eyeshadow (which totally brings out her eyes, if we may say so ourselves) — and captioned the snap, “I’m attracted to… people! [Gender is whatever].”</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312498" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TSRdUEG.png" alt="Ava Phillippe" width="600" height="492" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TSRdUEG.png 600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TSRdUEG-300x246.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TSRdUEG-150x123.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Can I get an amen?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="input-sentence~0">The next day — on the heels of coming out on Instagram — Phillippe also shared a Story saying, “I can [and] will block profiles commenting bigoted/hateful messages under my posts. </span><span id="input-sentence~1">My Instagram profile is not a place for cruelty/hate speech [and] I intend to keep it that way.” </span><span id="input-sentence~2">Double amen to that.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being reared in the spotlight (and being pretty open on social media), nothing is known about Phillippe&#8217;s love life until now. She did share a rare snapshot with boyfriend, Owen Mahoney, whom she&#8217;d been dating since 2019, on Instagram in June 2021. But the photo has since been removed, leaving me to wonder if the couple is still together. (That said, both Ava Phillippe and her mom still follow Mahoney on Instagram. So! TBD!)</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/avaphillippe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ava Phillippe<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-312497 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XxZCZOh.jpg" alt="Ava Phillippe" width="760" height="1223" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XxZCZOh.jpg 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XxZCZOh-186x300.jpg 186w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XxZCZOh-636x1024.jpg 636w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XxZCZOh-150x241.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a></h3>
<p>Witherspoon hasn&#8217;t officially commented on her daughter&#8217;s s*xuality or relationship status, save from posting heart-eyed emojis on Phillippe&#8217;s photo with Mahoney. On the other hand, she has expressed delight in Phillippe&#8217;s willingness to forge her own path.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ava Phillippe is so down-to-earth,” Witherspoon told InStyle in November 2021. “She wants to do great things in the world. She&#8217;s studying and learning and trying to find herself. It&#8217;s a big thing in life to try different things and figure out what is really your path.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In a 2020 interview with Variety, Witherspoon also shared that, “No one spoke to me about s*xuality when I was a teenager.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand what homos*xuality was,” she continued. “My grandparents didn’t explain it; my parents didn’t explain it. I had to learn from somebody I met on an audition in Los Angeles.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Witherspoon has apparently raised her <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-jennifer-garner-kids/">children</a> to have a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/sam-elliott-considers-benedict-cumberbatchs/">s*xuality</a> and gender. And we love seeing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Olivia Rodrigo&#8217;s debut album, published on May 21, received positive reviews and some criticism. On Sour, the singer drew inspiration from other musical artists, both past and present, and several songs on the album appear to be interpolations of songs by other popular artists. However, everything worked out in the end because Rodrigo credited the other artists by adding them to the credits (albeit a little late). So, how much do musicians like Hayley Williams and Taylor Swift profit from Olivia Rodrigo&#8217;s songs? The solution is somewhat extensive.</p>
<p>Olivia Rodrigo&#8217;s Sour has been out for more than three months, yet there&#8217;s still a lot of buzz about it online, especially following the singer&#8217;s recent update to the credits. On August 25, Hayley Williams and Josh Farro from Paramore appeared on the &#8220;Good 4 U credits list.&#8221; The song had long been compared to Paramore&#8217;s 2007 hit &#8220;Misery Business,&#8221; and many fans appreciated the choice to include them retroactively. However, by giving up half of her songwriting credits to the band members, Rodrigo forfeited a sizable portion of the song&#8217;s royalties.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312588" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VEEjk9O.png" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VEEjk9O.png 700w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VEEjk9O-300x200.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/VEEjk9O-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>According to Billboard, who calculated how much money the members of Paramore made from &#8220;Good 4 U,&#8221; the figure is in the millions. When streaming, sales, and radio activities are factored in; the track has produced at least $2.4 million in global publication royalties, according to the outlet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-312547 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gd0x0Yr.png" alt="Olivia Rodrigo " width="760" height="1012" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gd0x0Yr.png 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gd0x0Yr-225x300.png 225w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gd0x0Yr-640x853.png 640w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gd0x0Yr-150x200.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a></p>
<p>Swift, who appears on Sour&#8217;s &#8220;1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back&#8221; as a result of an interpolation of her song &#8220;New Year&#8217;s Day,&#8221; is also doing well. According to Billboard, the song hasn&#8217;t had as much financial success as the singles, but it has generated more than $258,379 in publishing royalties.</p>
<h3>Olivia Rodrigo</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312546" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Zvwss4p.png" alt="Olivia Rodrigo " width="760" height="1096" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Zvwss4p.png 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Zvwss4p-208x300.png 208w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Zvwss4p-710x1024.png 710w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Zvwss4p-150x216.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p>Swift has also earned more money as a result of Rodrigo&#8217;s track &#8220;Deja Vu.&#8221; <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/joe-alwyn-cheat-on-taylor-swift-emma-lairds/">Swift</a> and her songwriting team were added as writers for the single, which includes an interpolation of &#8220;Cruel Summer.&#8221; According to Billboard, Swift has earned around $325,678 in global publishing royalties. Meanwhile, her collaborators, <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/pete-davidson-i-wasnt-in-anyones-dms-and-no-one-was-in-mine-davidson-on-dating-some-of-the-most-famous-women-in-the-world/">Jack Antonoff</a> and Annie Clark, have earned $260,542 and $65,135, respectively.</p>
<p>Rodrigo&#8217;s debut album was a huge hit. Thus her new credits list is unlikely to have an effect on her. But those involved are undoubtedly making a lot of money off the record.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who have been married for 12 years, purchased a vineyard and château in southern France in 2008.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt is reportedly suing his ex-wife Angelina Jolie, claiming that she willfully sought to &#8216;inflict harm&#8217; on the reputation of their previously co-owned winery, Miraval, by selling her interests to a stranger.&#8217; According to People, the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star recently filed documents in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Since their divorce over five years ago, the ex-couple has been at war over the wine vineyard.</p>

<p>In 2008, the ex-couple purchased a vineyard and château in the south of France after a 12-year relationship. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith costars were married on the property, together with their six children. However, according to the outlet, Brad Pitt&#8217;s lawyers claim that when Jolie sold her shares to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer owned by Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler, she intended to harm the reputation of &#8216;the brand Pitt so carefully built.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to the site, Brad Pitt&#8217;s filings contain a claim that the couple agreed not to sell shares of their co-owned properties without first telling the other party and allege a breach of contract between Pitt&#8217;s firm, Mondo Bongo, and Jolie&#8217;s company, Nouvel. According to the BBC, Jolie did inform Pitt of her &#8216;sad&#8217; choice to sell in January 2021. Brad Pitt also claims in the complaint that Jolie contributed &#8216;nothing to [Château] Miraval&#8217;s success.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Pitt was the one who converted the winery &#8216;into a multimillion-dollar global corporation and one of the world&#8217;s most highly acclaimed manufacturers of rosé wine.&#8217; Pitt requests that damages be determined at a jury trial and that the sale be declared null and void because he thinks Shefler&#8217;s presence in the former couple&#8217;s wine business will degrade his work.</p>

<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a source told the outlet, “Mr Pitt’s lawsuit against Ms <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/amber-heard-wishes-career-like-angelina-jolie/">Jolie</a> is an extension of a false narrative, and the truth of the situation has still not been made public. After the events that led to Ms Jolie filing for divorce and her years devoted to caring for their children, Ms Jolie and the children have not been able to return to the property, and she made the difficult decision to sell her stake in the business.”</p>
<p>The source went on to say, “After making multiple offers to her ex-husband, and knowing the business will be inherited by their children, she found a business partner with experience in the alcohol industry.” The source adds, “It’s unfortunate that after she properly and legally exited the business, Mr Pitt is entangling her in multiple lawsuits.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In January 2022, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, or D.A.R.E. called out the hit HBO teen drama Euphoria for its depiction of drug use, sex, and violence. Zendaya, who plays one of the lead characters on the show, strongly responded to critics. But what did she say?</p>
<h3>D.A.R.E. takes a dig at Euphoria</h3>
<figure id="attachment_297871" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-297871" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-297871" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3-1024x576.webp" alt="euphoria" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3-150x84.webp 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zendaya-reveals-her-hope-for-Euphoria-Season-3.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-297871" class="wp-caption-text">D.A.R.E claims Euphoria promotes sex, violence and drug use amog teenagers</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/will-zendaya-exit-euphoria-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euphoria</a>, which premiered in 2019, follows Rue (played by Zendaya), a high school student struggling with addiction amid relationships, friendships, and her home life.</p>
<p>D.A.R.E which was established in the 1980s during the Ronald Reagan-era “war on drugs,” advocates for a zero-tolerance policy on drugs. The organization said in a statement against the show,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rather than further each parent’s desire to keep their children safe from the potentially horrific consequences of drug abuse and other high-risk behavior, HBO’s television drama, &#8216;Euphoria,&#8217; chooses to misguidedly glorify and erroneously depict high school student drug use, addiction, anonymous sex, violence, and other destructive behaviors as common and widespread in today’s world,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>D.A.R.E added it would like to consult with representatives of the show to present its concerns.</p>
<p>The statement further reads,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is unfortunate that HBO, social media, television program reviewers, and paid advertising have chosen to refer to the show as &#8216;groundbreaking,&#8217; rather than recognizing the potential negative consequences on school age children who today face unparalleled risks and mental health challenges,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Zendaya responds to critics</h3>
<p><iframe width="1038" height="584" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/trJO-ADgIco" title="Zendaya Shares Painful Experience Playing Rue In Euphoria" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A month after the statement from D.A.R.E and growing criticism against the show, Zendaya responded.</p>
<p>Now, the actress, who happens to be an executive producer on the series, posted a statement on social media warning viewers that the show could be triggering to some and emphasizing that it is for mature audiences.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know I’ve said this before, but I do want to reiterate to everyone that Euphoria is for mature audiences. This season, maybe even more so than the last, is deeply emotional and deals with subject matter that can be triggering and difficult to watch,”</p></blockquote>
<p>She added that viewers should &#8220;only watch it if you feel comfortable.”</p>
<p>Zendaya posted a similar warning before the show&#8217;s debut in 2019 saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just a reminder before tonight’s premiere, that Euphoria is for mature audiences. It’s a raw and honest portrait of addiction, anxiety, and the difficulties of navigating life today. There are scenes that are graphic, hard to watch, and can be triggering. Please only watch if you feel you can handle it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The show also makes it a point to run a disclaimer about mental health with a phone number for the National Alliance of Mental Health runs ahead of episodes dealing with mental health issues.</p>

<p>While HBO did not respond to critics, Zendaya told Entertainment Weekly that people should not be modeling their lives after Rue. She stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our show is in no way a moral tale to teach people how to live their life or what they should be doing. If anything, the feeling behind Euphoria, or whatever we have always been trying to do with it, is to hopefully help people feel a little bit less alone in their experience and their pain. And maybe feel like they&#8217;re not the only one going through or dealing with what they&#8217;re dealing with.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts? Does Euphoria promote addiction and drug use or is it helping today&#8217;s youth cope with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety? Let us know in the comments. Don&#8217;t forget to follow hiptoro for the latest celebrity news and gossip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bam Margera posted a new video in which he says some mean things about his family. But, as this is reported, Lamar Odom offered Bam Margera a free stay at one of his addiction treatment centers. Bam Margera says he heard about Lamar&#8217;s offer and will take him up on it.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://share.tmz.com/watch/2023-04-28-042823-bam-margera-1606653-609/" width="560" height="395" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bam Margera says he&#8217;s given up drinking because of some scary things that happened in his personal life.</h2>
<p>He also says he tested negative for m*th after his brother said he was hooked on the dangerous drug.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/bam-margera-drug-test-negative-drinking/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md/" rel="attachment wp-att-312026"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312026" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md.jpg" alt="Bam Margera" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md.jpg 728w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c4eb6ad289e74897be99454277e82062_md-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>Bam Margera put out a series of statements Friday, first saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>Well my brother made false accusations of me being on m*th. But when I wear to god and Phoenix the wolfs life I’m not, I went with my lawyers to urgent care. Guess what Jesse margera. The results are negative. Now you will be evicted from castlebam sooner than later. Get your f***in s*** out HOMOner. Oh wait… not no more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jess said that Bam was on m*th and hallucinating earlier this week when he was still on the run from the police. This really got under Bam&#8217;s skin, and he hasn&#8217;t stopped talking about it since. Bam denied these claims and told Jess that he would sue him for slander and kick him out of his house.</p>

<p>Bam also says he&#8217;s done drinking for the sake of his son, Phoenix.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been through official termoil with my family.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also thanked his current girlfriend, Jessica, for being there for him during his recent problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>For once I am not dating a hot dog strutting floozy.</p></blockquote>
<p>He praised Jessica for helping him hire Michael van der Veen as an attorney to help him with his ongoing case with his brother.</p>
<p>Finally, Bam takes a shot at his ex-wife, Missy Margera, whom he thinks tried to help the police find him while he was on the run last week.</p>
<p>As reported, Bam turned himself in to the police on Thursday. He had been on the run for four days after his brother told the police that Bam beat him up and threatened to kill him.</p>

<h3>Has Somebody Somewhere Been Renewed or Canceled?</h3>
<p>As of 30th April, 2023, HBO has not made any official announcement whether the show will be renewed for season 3 or canceled. But by looking at the ratings of season 2, we can expect another season in the series.</p>
<p>Season 2 had taken a massive jump from season 1 in terms of ratings. A total of 50% viewership of the show has been increased in season 2. This is a good indicator that the show might get renewed for season 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How to watch &#8216;Suzume&#8217;? &#8211;</strong> Makoto Shinkai gained worldwide recognition after his 2016 anime movie &#8216;Your Name&#8217; became a mega-hit. Prior to this, anime movies were mostly associated with the gentle beauty of Studio Ghibli. But &#8216;Your Name&#8217; not only showcased Shinkai&#8217;s breathtaking visuals and incredibly detailed storytelling but also made everyone aware that his future projects were a must-see.</p>
<p>After the success of ‘Your Name,’ Makoto Shinkai&#8217;s 2019 project ‘Weathering With You’ didn&#8217;t quite live up to the hype but still showcased his remarkable storytelling skills. Now, with his latest film <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzume no Tojimari</a>, Shinkai promises yet another exciting and emotionally engaging adventure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_306413" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-306413" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-306413" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still-1024x576.webp" alt="How to Watch the new anime movie ‘Suzume’ by Makoto Shinkai?" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still-300x169.webp 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still-768x432.webp 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still-150x84.webp 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Suzume_still.webp 1526w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-306413" class="wp-caption-text">A still from Suzume. | ©CoMIX Wave Films</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Shinkai&#8217;s latest film, Suzume, a 17-year-old girl encounters a mysterious young man who speaks of a door in her quiet town of Kyushu. She soon discovers a weathered door standing tall among ruins, and as she reaches for the knob, doors begin to open all across Japan, causing destruction and chaos. She discovers that she possesses a unique ability to close these portals and prevent further devastation. The film features stunning visuals of the stars, sunsets, and morning sky that guide Suzume on her perilous journey to close the doors and save Japan.</p>
<p>The movie has been well-received by both critics and audiences alike. It&#8217;s a captivating story of adventure and self-discovery, with reviewers praising its dazzling visuals and emotional depth.</p>

Other notable cast members include Shôta Sometani, Sairi Itô, Kotone Hanase, and Kana Hanazawa.</p>

<h3>How to watch &#8216;Suzume&#8217; Online?</h3>
<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s no news of the new hit movie being available for streaming anywhere. The distributors have chosen to have an exclusive theatrical release, given Shinkai&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a slight chance that the movie may be released on Crunchyroll in a few months. Although there&#8217;s no confirmation yet, considering that Crunchyroll previously released Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero in theaters and on their website, we may expect the same and expect it to release by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on this space for further updates as we receive more information.</p>
