<p>The 39-year-old former model has been living in homeless camps in California for the past seven years, according to reports.</p>
<p>Loni Willison, who used to model for a lot of magazines, was first seen living on the streets of LA in 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/loni-willison-searching-food-dumpster/70328569-12023019-image-a-43_1682641585746/" rel="attachment wp-att-313630"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313630" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70328569-12023019-image-a-43_1682641585746.jpg" alt="Loni Willison" width="630" height="721" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70328569-12023019-image-a-43_1682641585746.jpg 630w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70328569-12023019-image-a-43_1682641585746-262x300.jpg 262w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70328569-12023019-image-a-43_1682641585746-150x172.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a></p>
<p>The former cover girl was seen pushing her shopping cart through the streets of Santa Monica in pictures taken just this week. And while she did it, Loni Willison looked messy, had short hair, and had missing teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Loni Willison&#8217;s life seemed to fall apart after she broke up with Jeremy Jackson, a hot TV star.</h2>
<p>She was married to the <strong>Baywatch</strong> star from 2012 to 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p>While on the outside it seemed like their romance was picture perfect, Loni later claimed that Jeremy was physically abusive behind closed doors,</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>She alleged that their marriage was secretly filled with explosive drunken rows and nasty physical altercations that left her fearing for her life and suffering from multiple broken bones.</p></blockquote>
<p>The couple&#8217;s rocky marriage ended when, according to reports, Jeremy tried to strangle Loni Willison during a drunken fight.</p>
<p>After they broke up, the 42-year-old actor was on the 2015 season of Celebrity Big Brother.</p>
<p><a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/loni-willison-searching-food-dumpster/70349349-12025215-the_couple_appeared_as_happy_as_could_be_together_they_were_ofte-a-61_1682725480077-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-313628"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313628" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70349349-12025215-The_couple_appeared_as_happy_as_could_be_together_they_were_ofte-a-61_1682725480077-1.jpg" alt="Loni Willison and Jeremy Jackson" width="630" height="726" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70349349-12025215-The_couple_appeared_as_happy_as_could_be_together_they_were_ofte-a-61_1682725480077-1.jpg 630w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70349349-12025215-The_couple_appeared_as_happy_as_could_be_together_they_were_ofte-a-61_1682725480077-1-260x300.jpg 260w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/70349349-12025215-The_couple_appeared_as_happy_as_could_be_together_they_were_ofte-a-61_1682725480077-1-150x173.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Willison is said to have struggled with addiction and mental health issues after being in a bad relationship. Since then, she has been seen on the streets a lot, looking like she is homeless and digging through trash to find food.</p>
<p>Willison lost her job at a cosmetic surgery center in Los Angeles because she went crazy two years after she and Jackson broke up. She lost her apartment, car, and savings, so she was forced to live on the streets of the city.</p>
<p>After being found on the streets of LA in 2020, Loni told <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1645715/baywatch-jeremy-jackson-ex-wife-loni-willison-found-la/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sun</a> that she didn&#8217;t want anyone&#8217;s help.</p>

<blockquote><p>I haven’t spoken to Jeremy. I don’t want to speak to my friends, I’m doing just fine. I don’t want anyone to help me. I can live on my own. I’ve got everything I need right here. Nobody really cares about me and I don’t want to see them, they don’t want to see me.</p></blockquote>
<p>She told the outlet,</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven’t got a cell phone. I’ve got food and I’ve got a place to sleep. I get money here and there and there’s food in the bins and near the stores. There’s lots here.</p></blockquote>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AndrewTate-claims-poisoned-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>Andrew Tate claims that he has been poisoned, and has posted unusual videos of his supposedly worsening health.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old controversial social media influencer, who became famous for his posts about masculinity, has had a rough few months. On December 29, he and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania while police looked into allegations of s*xual assault, exploitation, organized crime, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>Romania&#8217;s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) caught the brothers along with two women in the same case.</p>
<p>They spent 30 days in a detention center and had their time there extended several times. Their requests to be set free were also turned down.</p>
<p><a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/andrew-tate-claims-poisoned-health-worse/2pkwpe3-scaled/" rel="attachment wp-att-313506"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313506" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Andrew Tate" width="1129" height="753" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1.jpg 1129w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2PKWPE3-scaled-1-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1129px) 100vw, 1129px" /></a></p>
<p>But on March 31, they were finally let go and put under house arrest by Romanian officials. The arrest was supposed to end, but it was just extended for another 30 days. This means that the brothers won&#8217;t be able to leave until at least May 29, while officials continue to look into what happened.</p>
<p>Since he has been on house arrest, Andrew Tate has posted a number of mysterious videos and messages, including a Tweet in which he seems to say that he will be shot as soon as he is freed.</p>
<blockquote><p>I prepare my body to absorb the brutal kinetics of piercing lead,</p></blockquote>
<p>he wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>As all other silencing attempts fail, and stage 3 approaches &#8211; I anticipate a bullet will be the chosen utensil of pacification. I can only pray and prepare. I will force myself to breathe the best I can. I promise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the former <strong>Big Brother</strong> contestant, who has denied all the accusations against him and Tristan, has said on his Twitter page that he may have been poisoned and had a bad reaction.</p>
<p>Andrew Tate penned in a now-deleted tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Face swollen. Blood pressure is through the roof. Skins on fire. Hard to breathe. Some sort of severe reaction or poison. Only had coffee and water so far today. All appeared in the last 5mins,</p></blockquote>
<p>alongside a picture and video showing the severity of the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Tate gets &quot;some sort of severe reaction or poison&quot;. Swollen face and can&#39;t breathe properly!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>After that, Andrew Tate&#8217;s account, which was apparently updated by a third party, said that he wasn&#8217;t going to take medicine because he was afraid a doctor would kill him with injections. In another message, they wrote that he has no allergies and won&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew is not allergic to anything,</p></blockquote>
<p>one post read, according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/andrew-tate-refuses-doctor-influencers-29832166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mirror</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>This has never happened before. Has only had water and coffee today. Either an insect bite or some matrix attack insanity in his bottled water. He’s refusing doctors and is focusing on tea and breathing. Will keep you all updated.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrews fine. Says that pain is part of life. He says the doctor will inject him with &#8216;who knows what&#8217; and kill him. He&#8217;s in lotus position and drinking tea. As long as he can breathe he refuses medical attention &#8211; so far so good. The question is where this came from,</p></blockquote>
<p>they added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The former kickboxing world champion is being held as part of an investigation, and he is also being sued by three women who say he r*ped and abused them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>According to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/andrew-tate-three-women-to-sue-influencer-claiming-he-raped-and-abused-them-12856117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky News</a>, the women made these accusations against Andrew Tate in 2015, which is eight years ago.</h2>
<p>However, detectives on the case didn&#8217;t take them seriously, so the case was eventually dropped.</p>
<p>Since 2013, the alleged victims had been working as webcam models for Andrew Tate in Luton, where they said they were mistreated, underpaid, and threatened so they wouldn&#8217;t go to the police.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BrittneyGriner-press-conference-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>Brittney Griner was reduced to tears during her first press conference since she got out of Russian prison.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old WNBA star got emotional when she saw a Phoenix Mercury reporter for the first time since she was released in 2022.</p>
<p>Since being released from detention in Russia in December, the athlete had not been able to talk to reporters or the media until the press conference.</p>
<blockquote><p>Aw, so good to see you,</p></blockquote>
<p>Brittney Griner said after recognizing the reporter in the crowd. Both of them were having trouble speaking through their tears. When the reporter asked Brittney Griner how she had the courage to tell her story, she had tears in her eyes.</p>
<blockquote><p>See, you&#8217;re crying and now you made me cry,</p></blockquote>
<p>Griner responded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Brittney Griner gets emotional at her first press conference after getting out of prison:</strong></h2>

<blockquote><p>You know, I&#8217;m no stranger to hard times. Just digging deep honestly, you&#8217;re going to be faced with adversities throughout your life &#8211; this was a pretty big one,</p></blockquote>
<p>she thought back on the 10 months she spent in Russian custody. The basketball player also said that she &#8220;relied&#8221; on her &#8220;hard work&#8221; to get through the situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>I know this sounds so small, but you know, dying in practice and just hard workouts, you find a way to just grind it out. Put your head down and keep moving,</p></blockquote>
<p>she added saying that she never stopped moving while she was in a Russian prison.</p>
<blockquote><p>That was my thing&#8230;never get too focused on the now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, Brittney Griner also talked about what she had learned since her first arrest in February 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p>Life is short. Things can change at the stroke of a match. Appreciate every moment. Don&#8217;t take it for granted, but it&#8217;s so true. Once something like this happens to you, when people say that it hits home, it hits closer to you,</p></blockquote>
<p>she admitted, per <a href="https://people.com/sports/brittney-griner-tears-up-reuniting-with-mercury-reporter-in-first-press-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/brittney-griner-conference-emotional/2jh4dcr-scaled/" rel="attachment wp-att-313319"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313319" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Brittney Griner" width="1129" height="753" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1.jpg 1129w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2JH4DCR-scaled-1-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1129px) 100vw, 1129px" /></a></p>
<p>Griner did tell reporters, though, that she would not play basketball overseas again.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m never going overseas to play again unless I&#8217;m representing my country at the Olympics. If I make that team, that would be the only time I would leave the US soil, and that&#8217;s just to represent the USA.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll say this, the whole reason a lot of us go over is the pay gap. A lot of us go over there to make an income, to support our families, to support ourselves,</p></blockquote>
<p>Griner explained that she only played in international leagues outside of the United States during the basketball offseason to make money since men&#8217;s basketball players make a lot more.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-and-Sarada-150x150.png" /> <div><p>The Boruto Manga Continues to Perpetuate Gender Stereotypes in Chapter 78 and Beyond.</p>
<p>The pattern of showing disrespect towards female shinobi in Boruto Manga and Anime is evident through the portrayal of Sarada, <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/boruto-naruto-next-generations-related/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sasuke&#8217;s daughter</a>. Although the mistreatment that she endures could potentially happen to any male character, it is the recurrence of such offenses against both her and her gender that is inexcusable. This is not the first instance of Boruto being guilty of such behavior, and the persistent portrayal of female shinobi in a derogatory manner highlights a deep-seated problem within the series.</p>
<p>In <a title="Boruto Manga chapter 78 : Naruto Next Generations" href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/boruto-chapter-78/chapter/26182?action=read" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boruto Manga chapter 78 : Naruto Next Generations</a>, created and supervised by Masashi Kishimoto, illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto, and written by Ukyo Kodachi, Sarada demonstrates bravery and loyalty by coming to Boruto&#8217;s aid upon learning of a rogue Kawaki&#8217;s plan to eliminate him. However, despite her valiant efforts, she finds herself in a dangerous situation that ultimately necessitates Boruto&#8217;s intervention to protect her. This turn of events not only puts Boruto&#8217;s safety at risk but also perpetuates the problematic trend of female shinobi being portrayed as helpless and in need of male rescue, an all-too-common trope in the Naruto universe.</p>
<h3>Boruto Manga: Undermining Sarada&#8217;s Heroic Deed</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_312646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-312646" style="width: 1632px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-312646" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1.png" alt="Boruto Manga" width="1632" height="866" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1.png 1632w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-300x159.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1024x543.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-768x408.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1536x815.png 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1600x849.png 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-150x80.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-312646" class="wp-caption-text">Boruto Manga</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Sarada&#8217;s proven competence as a shinobi, her act of bravery in saving Boruto was supposed to be a pivotal moment for her character, but instead, Boruto exploited it to mock and belittle her. In risking her life to save her friend and potential love interest, she found herself in the midst of the first confrontation between two key characters at a critical point in the manga. However, the author failed to challenge the typical gender stereotypes present in fiction by portraying Sarada, who was once a heroic figure, as a &#8220;damsel in distress&#8221; who required Boruto&#8217;s intervention to rescue her, resulting in him suffering severe injuries at his own expense.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="1038" height="584" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzkzhbMtD1I" title="Sarada Awakens Mangekyou Sharingan to Protect Boruto and Reveals Loving Him - Boruto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Ironically, one of Sarada&#8217;s most significant moments in the Boruto Manga was marred by the way it happened. In earlier chapters 41 and 42, Kawaki tells Sarada how to use her family&#8217;s Sharingan, despite only having learned about its abilities himself moments earlier. This could be viewed as further evidence of how Sasuke&#8217;s absence has affected Sarada&#8217;s understanding of her powers.</p>
<h5><a title="[Redditors expressed disappointment and frustration at Sasuke&#039;s prolonged absence from Sarada&#039;s life]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ugg9rc/is_sasukes_mission_really_a_valid_excuse_for_his/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Redditors expressed disappointment and frustration at Sasuke&#8217;s prolonged absence from Sarada&#8217;s life]</a></h5>
<p>However, the fact that a male character had to instruct a female character on how to fight raises questions about gender roles and reinforces a troubling trend of male characters dominating and dictating female characters&#8217; actions and abilities in the story.</p>
<h3>Boruto Manga: Hinata&#8217;s Character Falls Prey to Stereotypical Portrayal</h3>
<figure id="attachment_312631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-312631" style="width: 1252px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-312631" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga.png" alt="Boruto Manga" width="1252" height="623" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga.png 1252w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-300x149.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1024x510.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-768x382.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1252px) 100vw, 1252px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-312631" class="wp-caption-text">Boruto Manga</figcaption></figure>
<p>These regressive and unwarranted gender biases serve to underscore how Boruto consistently mistreats its female shinobi. Hinata is perhaps the most glaring example of this. While her role as a homemaker is not inherently problematic, the series portrays her as constantly failing in this role, causing her son to comfort her while he is on the verge of risking his life. Furthermore, there are instances when Hinata supposedly fights in Boruto, but the show chooses to omit these scenes, or she is presented with an ideal adversary, such as Ao, who is infamous for murdering her clan, but has no role in his defeat. This is not to mention the vast majority of other female fighters who are either overlooked or relegated to stereotypical roles like running flower shops, despite years of battlefield experience. In light of all this, it is clear that having Sarada fail to rescue Boruto and necessitate his rescue instead is entirely disrespectful and unwarranted.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Family-Guy-movie-why-theres-no-movie-150x150.webp" /> <div><p><strong>Family Guy Movie?</strong> Despite the series&#8217; continued success on TV, the executive producers behind the show have yet to make the jump to the big screen. Unlike <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers</em>, which have had their own feature films, Family Guy has only had a feature-length home media release. Even though the show has seen monumental success ever since 20th Century Fox brought it back from the cancellation, a proper movie adaptation has not yet been made.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emmys.com/news/features/cover-animation-special" target="_blank" rel="noopener">During a recent interview with Emmy Magazine</a>, Family Guy executive producers Alec Sulkin and Rich Appel discussed why a Family Guy movie has yet to materialize. They attributed the delay to the fact that series creator Seth MacFarlane has been busy with several other projects. Although the producers joked about some of MacFarlane&#8217;s cinematic misses, they made it clear that his schedule has been the primary factor preventing the development of a movie.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-312221" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-1024x613.jpg" alt="The Family Guy Movie Dilemma: Why It's Been a Decade and Still No Film" width="1024" height="613" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-300x179.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-768x460.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-1536x919.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-1600x957.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie-150x90.jpg 150w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AnyConv.com__stewie-family-guy-movie.jpg 1658w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Will There Be A Family Guy Movie?</h2>
<p>When questioned about the possibility of a movie, executive producer Alec Sulkin pointed out that movies can be unpredictable. He referenced some of Seth MacFarlane&#8217;s previous cinematic efforts, such as <em>Ted 2</em>, which were not as successful as the original. Rich Appel, on the other hand, provided a more specific reason why a Family Guy movie hasn&#8217;t been made yet. According to him, Seth MacFarlane is too busy with other projects, including the Ted TV series and book club, to devote time to a movie. Unfortunately, this means that fans may have to wait even longer for the much-anticipated movie of the beloved series.</p>
<figure id="attachment_312228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-312228" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-312228" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-1024x576.jpg" alt="The Family Guy Movie Dilemma: Why It's Been a Decade and Still No Film" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peter-why-theres-no-family-guy-movie-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-312228" class="wp-caption-text">FAMILY GUY: The guys try to start a podcast, but Peter branches out as a DJ in the “Peter&#8217;s Def Jam” episode of FAMILY GUY. © 2017 TCFFC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the show&#8217;s success, the talented and star-studded <a href="https://hiptoro.com/p/patrick-warburton-family-guy-voice-actor-doesnt-feel-sorry-for-shows-controversial-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Guy cast</a> has also helped propel the show forward. Lead actor and creator Seth MacFarlane voices several of the Family Guy characters, including Peter, Stewie, and Brian, among others. The rest of the cast includes Alex Borstein, Mila Kunis, Seth Green, and Mike Henry. The show&#8217;s recent two-season pick-up and renewal through 2025 by 20th Television Animation ensures that the cast and crew will continue their journey, possibly culminating in a movie one day.</p>

<p>The digital version is now available for pre-order on iTunes and Amazon Prime Video. The DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD editions, like the digital release, are available for pre-order, but there is no word on when they will be ready. Fans may now replay the train scene as many times as they want now that it has been digitally distributed in the United States, in order to find all the hidden links to not just the Scream films, but horror films in general.</p>
<h2>Paramount+ plans for customers</h2>
<p>Paramount+ customers may combine with Showtime to watch Scream VI free online and other original shows including Yellowjackets, Your Honour, George and Tammy, and more.

<h2>How to watch Scream VI  in Uk/Australia?</h2>

<p>The Scream films have dependably been excellent, and this tendency is unlikely to alter in the near future. Scream 6 received a perfect nine out of 10 from us for its exceptional character development, amazing set pieces, and unique storyline. This film is required watching for every Scream franchise enthusiast.</p>

<h2>One Piece Chapter 1083 Spoilers according to Reddit</h2>
<p>A Redditor by the username u/CocaPepsiPepper posted a series of One Piece chapter 1083 spoilers on the r/Piratefolk subreddit. The spoilers were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Mihawk decides to take down Red Haired first. He tracks him across the planet with his Observation and uses his Armament to stretch his strike across the Grand Line</li>
<li>Shanks blocks it and uses his Conqueror to launch his ship to Buggy’s island from Elbaf</li>
<li>Mihawk and Shanks clash, splitting the sky two different ways and literally shaking the Grand Line</li>
<li>Mihawk observes Marineford to see what they’re saying, Sengoku says that the Marines purposefully pushed false Kaido hype and that both Shanks and Mihawk are fitting contestants for the title of WSC/WSM.</li>
<li>Mihawk tries to find Akainu but he’s not at Marineford.</li>
<li>Cut to Kamabaka, Dragon is looking out at the sea, which is evaporating. Akainu is sprinting head-first to the island.</li>
<li>Dragon is revealed to have an awakened Weather Logia and he summons a rainstorm. The rain and wind is covered in CoA and the lightning is black like CoC.</li>
<li>Akainu burns through the weather with a Hell Hound the size of Kamabaka, Dragon is a bit scared.</li>
<li>Sabo leaps ahead of Dragon and coats his pipe in ACoC, knocking the Hell Hound away.</li>
<li>Akainu coats his own fist in ACoC, flies up to Sabo with his magma flight and they clash in an epic double-page spread with the Moon in the background, an explosion is happening on the Moon.</li>
<li>Cut to space, we are Enel commenting on the size of the CoC clashes going on, visible from space. Enel is fighting somebody using his awakened Goro Goro Fruit power which allows him to use pure Conqueror’s.</li>
<li>Enel’s opponent is the eleventh Titanic Captain, Urouge, who ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Jesus Christ. Urouge is trying to recruit or kill Enel.</li>
<li>Final page shows all these events being viewed through Observation, manifested as a screen, in the Room of Flowers. Imu is watching it while conversing with a man who is chained to the final Road Poneglyph in the back of the room. The man is Rocks D. Xebec.&#8221; </li>
</ul>

<h2>How fake are these One Piece Chapter 1083 spoilers?</h2>
<p>Many comments under the post started calling out the OP on the fake spoilers. Some were sarcastic, while others were funny. A user, u/Prize-Nothing8067, commented, &#8220;You forgot the part where Sanji breaks his leg against Jack (Sanji taking an L in early spoilers is mandatory)&#8221;. While some critical comments were being downvoted for being mean.</p>
<figure id="attachment_311406" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-311406" style="width: 974px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-311406" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mean-reddit-comments-lol.png" alt="" width="974" height="417" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mean-reddit-comments-lol.png 974w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mean-reddit-comments-lol-300x128.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mean-reddit-comments-lol-768x329.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mean-reddit-comments-lol-150x64.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-311406" class="wp-caption-text">Some downvoted comments below the post.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The real reason everyone knows this is fake is that the spoilers for One Piece chapter 1082 have not yet been leaked. The chapter is said to be released on May 7th, 2023. More details on the release date can be <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/one-piece-chapter-1082-release-date-spoilers-oda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found here</a>. With spoilers for chapter 1082 just released as of yet, it will be hard to predict the next chapter. This is a blatant giveaway. Of course, the post was intended to be funny and sarcastic and not meant to be taken seriously. There are some theories available on Youtube that are a lot more believable than this Reddit post.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JadaPinkettSmith-RedTableTalk-FB-cancellation-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>If the layoffs at BuzzFeed, Bustle, Insider, and VICE weren&#8217;t enough, Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s popular Facebook show <strong>Red Table Talk</strong> has just been canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/red-table-talk-canceled-mina-lefevre-exits-facebook-watch-ends-originals-meta-1235337005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a> wrote about how Meta, the company that owns the social media platform, is shutting down its Facebook Watch originals. This includes Pinkett Smith&#8217;s Daytime Emmy-winning talk show, on which her daughter Willow Smith and her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris appear.</p>
<p>Since it started in 2018, the hugely popular show has aired 129 episodes over five seasons and gained 11 million social media followers.</p>
<p>Most notably, 51-year-old Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s show had some pretty explosive interviews, like when she talked to her husband about her &#8220;entanglement&#8221; with August Alsina and when Jordyn Woods sat down for the first time after the cheating triangle between Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson, and Khloe Kardashian.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jada Pinkett Smith also used her platform to talk about Smith&#8217;s Oscars slap, which went viral and is still hurting his career.</h2>
<p>The show is made by Jada Pinkett Smith and Will&#8217;s company, Westbrook Studios, which is reportedly looking for a new platform.</p>
<p>Since the news came out, Jada Pinkett Smith said something about the situation on the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Facebook</strong></span> page for the show.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are so grateful to have had such a beautiful partnership and we are sorry to see the entire team disband,</p></blockquote>
<p>it read.</p>
<blockquote><p>We wish everyone well in their new journeys to come.&#8221; The statement also that the show is &#8220;in talks of finding a new home.</p></blockquote>

<h2>My Hero Academia Chapter 387 spoilers: a brief history of the Himura Family.</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/my-hero-academia-chapter-387-spoilers-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The raw scans for Chapter 387</a> were leaked online and the final panels left the fans in utter shock. Although the focus was shifted from All Might vs All For One, fans were instead given another phenomenal chapter involving the Todoroki family.</p>
<p>The chapter begins with Geten and Mr. Compress having a talk in prison. Geten tells him about the Himura family&#8217;s blood and their legacy. He says that they all belong to many different lineages that are very rich and prideful. This is the family that Rei Todoroki, the parent of Touya, Natsuo, Fuyumi, and Shoto, is from.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">let&#39;s be honest, most of the Todoroki&#39;s good genes came from Rei, especially their looks</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As the age of Quirks began getting more advanced, the family started losing their prestige. The family wanted to keep their blood pure and as a result, started marrying distant relatives. This almost led the family to go extinct. As a result, the main branch family members were sold into arranged marriages.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

Geten tells the story of the Himura family (of which he and Rei Todoroki are part). He then asks Compress to tell him his story, because they have a lot of time. Who knows if they will fight again <a href="https://t.co/g7mYaqGSPl" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/g7mYaqGSPl</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is how Rie married Endeavor whose real name is Enji Todoroki. Geten then reveals that he was lost but Redestro found him and raised him but he belongs to the Himura family. He then tells that many of the Himura family members are not aware of how their quirks work as they advance and are not fully aware of their potential.</p>
<h2>A fight between father and son.</h2>
<p>My Hero Academia chapter 387 spoilers then shift to the fight between Endeavor and Dabi. They are 800 meters away from Gunga. Endeavor leans about the impending explosion of Dabi. He realizes that many civilians and Heroes who are fighting Toga’s twice clones are also in range of the blast. Endeavor is exhausted and tired from fighting All For One and losing an arm in the process which puts him at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Dabi flies over to Endeavor and shouts, “Look at me, Dad.” Endeavor sees this as a young Toya saying the same thing while smiling because of this, he cannot dodge the huge flaming punch from Dabi. After this, massive pillars of flame start breaking from the ground, and Endeavor asks Daabi to put them out.</p>

<p>However, Dabi is so out of it that he starts saying childish phrases like “Look at me” and “Play with me Natsu”. Then Endeavor realizes that Dabi cannot think on his own at the moment and thinks about how he is alive despite the temperature of his fire.</p>

<h2>Dabi has new powers in My hero academia chapter 387 spoilers</h2>
<p>Endeavor then extends his hand toward Dabi’s chest. He starts to think about how there are two kinds of near-death phenomena. First is when an already existing ability is awakened, such as when Bakugo wakened his during the Paranormal Liberation War. The second is when a completely new type of ability is awakened, such as what is happening to Dabi right now.</p>
<p>Then we see ice coming out of Dabi’s chest, which, unknown to him, he is making himself. This means he has also inherited his mother&#8217;s quirk as well. This means he is just like Shoto now with Half-Cold Half-Hot abilities.</p>
<h2>An unexpected savior</h2>
<p>In My Hero Academia Chapter 387 spoilers, Endeavor, after seeing this new ability of Dabi, comes to think that everything that happened to his family is his fault. While he wants to live and pay for his wrongdoings, he realizes that Touya will not stop killing others in order to seek revenge on his father.</p>
<p>Endeavour then takes this as the result of failing to take proper care of his son and then thinks of sacrificing himself for his son. He holds Dabi tight in a hug and taking advantage of Dabi’s flames flies as high as possible. Too much heat causes him to lose consciousness, but then, much to our shock, Rei Todoroki appears and uses her ice to quell Dabi’s flames.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JackHarlow-Eminem-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>In one of the songs on his new album, <strong>Jackman</strong>, Jack Harlow makes a strong claim.</p>
<p>In the song <strong>They Don&#8217;t Love It</strong>, he calls himself &#8216;the hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters.&#8217; This is a reference to Eminem&#8217;s famous line from the song Lose Yourself.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old rapper then raps in a tasteful way about how he beats his competitors without saying who they are.</p>
<p>The singer who made the hit &#8220;First Class&#8221; released his highly-anticipated third studio album on Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jack Harlow will also be in the <span style="color: #1ce783;"><strong>Hulu</strong></span> remake of <strong>White Men Can&#8217;t Jump</strong>, which will come out next month.</h2>

<p>After making his bold claim, Jack Harlow went on to list all the reasons why he thinks he should get the silver medal for the best white rapper after 50, who calls himself the Rap God.</p>
<blockquote><p>And hold the comments &#8217;cause I promise you I&#8217;m honestly better than whoever came to your head right then,</p></blockquote>
<p>Jack Harlow rapped as he dissed his adversaries lyrically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">They ain&#8217;t cut from the same thread like him,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">he continued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">They don&#8217;t study, doin&#8217; work to get ahead like him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">They don&#8217;t toss and turn in the f***in&#8217; bed like him, &#8217;cause they don&#8217;t love it,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">the lyrics went.</p>
<p>After his last album, &#8220;<strong>Come Home the Kids Miss You,</strong>&#8221; was criticized for being too commercial, <strong>Jackman</strong> takes the Louisville native back to his Kentucky roots.</p>
<p>His new album sounds like the music he made at the start of his career, which helped him get to where he is now.</p>
<p>In the same way, the cover art for his most recent project is reminiscent of his earlier work.</p>
<p>On the cover of the album, Jack Harlow stands shirtless in an alley in the rural suburbs of his hometown with his arms crossed.</p>

<p>The style of the picture made it look like it was taken with an old-fashioned film camera.</p>
<p>On the back cover, the same tone and low-clarity filter was used, but the image was of a large tree trunk crushing a car in a more upscale suburb.</p>
<p><strong>Jackman</strong> has a total of 10 tracks, and it&#8217;s surprising that none of them have any guest artists.</p>
<p>Common Ground is the name of the first song.</p>
<p>Following the lead-off are: They Don&#8217;t Love It; Ambition; Is That Ight?; Gang Gang Gang; Denver; No Enhancers; It Can&#8217;t Be; Blame On Me; and Questions.</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to be the face of my s*** — like the face of my generation — for these next 10 years,</p></blockquote>
<p>he had told <a class="class" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jack-harlow-jackman-album-announcement-1234724143/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone</a> last year before he released Come Home the Kids Miss You.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">We need more people in my generation that are trying to be the best, and you can&#8217;t do that with just ear candy, vibe records,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">he explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">You got to come out swinging sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">My new s*** is much more serious,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Jack Harlow also said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Right now, my message is letting [everybody] know I love hip-hop, and I&#8217;m one of the best in my generation</p>

<p>He told the magazine that even though he changed his appearance, he was still the same person inside. He was talking about his sudden rise to fame.</p>
<blockquote><p>It took me a while to take my glasses off,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said, perhaps in more than just a literal sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>I felt literally tethered to them, because I felt like, &#8220;You&#8217;re the rapper with glasses that can spit really well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He says that his personality hasn&#8217;t changed at all, even though he&#8217;s become so famous.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m as goofy as I am. I&#8217;m as smooth as I am. I&#8217;m as funny as I am. I&#8217;m as serious as I am. I&#8217;m all those things,</p></blockquote>
<p>Jack Harlow said.</p>
<blockquote><p>The totality of myself that I&#8217;m honoring is why I&#8217;m being embraced by hip-hop.</p></blockquote>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hiptoro-Thumbnail-2023-05-01T033821.663-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>Hank Azaria has spoken out about the controversy that surrounded his portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon in <a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/15-times-the-simpsons-ended-up-predicting-the-future/">The Simpsons</a>.</p>
<p>Many viewers of the renowned primetime cartoon show would recognize Apu as an Indian immigrant who owns the popular convenience shop Kwik-E-Mart. He is well-known for his catchphrase, &#8220;Thank you, please come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The character&#8217;s initial voice was given by 59-year-old Hank Azaria, who made his Apu debut in 1989 and lasted for 29 seasons. However, in the 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu, comedian Hari Kondabolu, who is of Indian descent, called out the actor and show creators.</p>
<p>Kondabolu highlighted his dissatisfaction with the character&#8217;s real-life implications and Hollywood&#8217;s frequent representations of South Asians.</p>
<p>As a result, Hank Azaria announced in 2020 that he would be stepping down from the position.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312806" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD.png" alt="" width="1052" height="1274" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD.png 1052w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD-248x300.png 248w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD-846x1024.png 846w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD-768x930.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EbmN1XD-150x182.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px" /></p>
<p>Hank Azaria last apologized for playing the character on Dax Shepard&#8217;s popular Armchair Expert podcast in 2021, saying, &#8220;Part of me feels like I need to personally apologize to every single Indian person in this country.&#8221; &#8220;And sometimes I do,&#8221; according to<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/simpsons-hank-azaria-apu-apology-b1830263.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Independent.</a></p>
<p>However, he didn&#8217;t have a public conversation with the 40-year-old writer until recently when the pair addressed the controversy in NPR&#8217;s podcast Code Switch, in the recent episode titled, &#8216;The Fallout of a Callout&#8217;.</p>
<p>The actor admitted that he was &#8220;afraid&#8221; to discuss the issue with Kondabolu and refused his requests to appear in the documentary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was really freaked out,&#8221; Hank Azaria told him on the podcast. &#8220;You know, you’re a comedian, and some of your stuff is gotcha, you know, and has bite to it, as well it should. It’s hilarious and it makes good points. Being on the other end of that really, really scared me, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know if I would have felt safe to have the conversation privately, let alone roll them, you know, we’re going to record it,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Hank Azaria</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-312805 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx.jpg" alt="Hank Azaria" width="1052" height="1511" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx.jpg 1052w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx-209x300.jpg 209w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx-713x1024.jpg 713w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx-768x1103.jpg 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0PkMJOx-150x215.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px" /></p>
<p>The host questioned Hank Azaria if he thought his portrayal of Apu had created a place for the &#8220;dehumanization&#8221; of Brown people in America.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yeah I have thought about that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it’s important to point out that pre-Hari, I had not thought about that stuff… I had to be told 54 times before it sunk in. I think about that all the time now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;Through my role in Apu and what I created in Hollywood messaging – which is a big deal in this country and around the world – I helped to create a pretty marginalizing, dehumanizing stereotype.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312804" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb.png" alt="" width="1052" height="592" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb.png 1052w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb-300x169.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb-1024x576.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb-768x432.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XpIBDDb-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The voice actor recalled reading a news story about a Middle-Eastern man who was attacked and called Apu by his assaulters, and said: &#8220;I think if I had any doubts at that point… I got the answer. Apu had become a slur,&#8221; to which Kondabolu agreed by saying: &#8220;When something is used in hate violence, it’s pretty clear.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/apus-character-to-be-removed-from-the-simpsons/">Apu</a> has been absent from the series since Hank Azaria&#8217;s departure from the role.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hiptoro-Thumbnail-2023-05-01T031324.695-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>Danielle Bregoli, aka Bhad Bhabie, has spoken up about her mother&#8217;s concerns about how she makes a living.</p>
<p>After appearing on Dr. Phil&#8217;s lifestyle talk show, the 20-year-old rapper and model Bhad Bhabie rose to prominence in 2016.</p>
<p>In the episode headed &#8216;I Want to Stop Car-Stealing, Knife-Waving, and Twerking,&#8217; Bregoli, the &#8217;13-Year-Old Daughter Who Tried to Frame Me for a Crime,&#8217; earned international notoriety for her bizarre behavior and for encouraging audience members to &#8220;catch her outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>After establishing a music career, Bhad Bhabie ventured onto a considerably more lucrative business when Bhad Bhabie debuted on OnlyFans at 18.</p>
<p>Despite her detractors, the move was a success, with reports at the time suggesting the Florida teen made more than $1 million in just six hours.</p>

<p>And, after Forbes named Bregoli one of the highest-earning creators of 2022, Bhad Bhabie later revealed that she earned more than $49 million from her OnlyFans alone in 2021.</p>
<p>Bhad Bhabie has now spoken with supermodel and actress Emily Ratajkowski about her riches, family, and rumors of plastic surgery.</p>
<p>Bregoli talked up about her OnlyFans fortune on the High Low with EmRata, saying, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t go like that for everybody.&#8221; People have approached me and said, &#8216;I&#8217;m just going to do it like you do it.&#8217; And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;Ahhh no.'&#8221;</p>
<h3>Bhad Bhabie</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoOn9_cuUMv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312756" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aDGCgOz.png" alt="Bhad Bhabie" width="602" height="967" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aDGCgOz.png 602w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aDGCgOz-187x300.png 187w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aDGCgOz-150x241.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s situational,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I was kept covered up for so long, right, with how they were making me dress and s***. And I was young. It&#8217;s creepy but at the same time&#8230;18 is 18. That&#8217;s what they said it was, so that&#8217;s what they said it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s a billion percent okay? No. But at the same time, it&#8217;s like if they ain&#8217;t going to find it here, they&#8217;ll find it somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>And speaking about what her mom thinks of the venture, Bregoli said: &#8220;That lady love money. She don&#8217;t care where it comes from!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout the interview, the 20-year-old described her mother as a &#8220;narcissist&#8221; who had been emailing the Dr. Phil show for years before being accepted.</p>
<p>She then joked about putting her mother in a nursing facility, stating, &#8220;I&#8217;mma tell &#8217;em her a** got dementia.&#8221; She can&#8217;t have a phone or anything else. Put her in a room.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the end of the day, I get the last laugh every time, so it&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bregoli also denied rumors of<a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/kylie-jenner-not-much-plastic-surgery-face/"> plastic surgery</a>, claiming that the only <a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/victoria-beckham-47-laser-skin-treatment/">treatments</a> she&#8217;s had are &#8220;two rounds of [silicone] a** shots&#8221; when she was 16, veneers, Sculptra filler, and lip fillers.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hiptoro-Thumbnail-2023-05-01T025638.929-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>I know Katy Perry made an awesome cameo in Taylor Swift&#8217;s &#8220;You Need To Calm Down&#8221; music video a month ago on July 17, but I&#8217;m still not over it. I mean, every time I hear the song, I imagine the &#8220;Firework&#8221; vocalist dressed as a hamburger hugging T. Swizzle dressed as french fries, and I get all the feels. Anything is freaking possible if these two former enemies can bury the hatchet. However, it appears that the big reunion came with a catch. We now know Katy Perry&#8217;s one requirement before reconciling with Taylor Swift, thanks to a new interview on KIIS 1065&#8217;s The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show. And it had everything to do with one of TayTay&#8217;s felines.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312672" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ojfcSmN.png" alt="" width="560" height="865" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ojfcSmN.png 560w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ojfcSmN-194x300.png 194w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ojfcSmN-150x232.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>But none of this happened overnight. So, before telling the cat story, Katy Perry revealed all of the baby steps involved in her reconciliation with Swift.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It kind of was a process,&#8221; Katy Perry told Kyle &amp; Jackie O on July 16. &#8220;I sent her a literal olive branch and a note, apologizing for my part in all of it when she started her Reputation tour.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Swift posted a picture of the present on her Instagram Story in May 2018. In case you missed it, here it is:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312671" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eUfvVWe.png" alt="" width="760" height="1077" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eUfvVWe.png 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eUfvVWe-212x300.png 212w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eUfvVWe-723x1024.png 723w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eUfvVWe-150x213.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p>Pretty cute.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just thought, you know, she was about to embark on something new and big and needed the support,&#8221; Katy Perry explained. &#8220;And truly&#8230; I realized how much we have in common. And maybe there&#8217;s only five other people in the world that can have the same type of conversations and understand where we&#8217;re coming from, and that we should celebrate our commonality and our friendship and to be able to be there for each other.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She is not mistaken. Nonetheless, nothing happened right away. Katy Perry then started meeting Swift at Oscar parties with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just went up to her and I was like, &#8216;Hey, you know, it&#8217;s been a long time, and I think we&#8217;ve grown up a little bit. And I just wanted to say I&#8217;m sorry, and that I&#8217;m really here for you, and that I love you and, you know, I hope that we can be friends in the future,'&#8221; Perry recalled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swift then obtained Perry&#8217;s phone number, the two began texting, and finally, the &#8220;ME!&#8221; singer invited her to meet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;She invited me over to her house, and she made me some cookies,&#8221; Katy Perry revealed. &#8220;And she actually makes those cookies, and they&#8217;re actually so delicious.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the cookies she was referring to:</p>
<h3>Katy Perry</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bylq5qjHUwj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-312665 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bbu6SS6.png" alt="Katy Perry" width="581" height="914" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bbu6SS6.png 581w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bbu6SS6-191x300.png 191w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bbu6SS6-150x236.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></a></p>
<p>They do look delectable, don&#8217;t they? Maybe Swift can sell them in her store alongside the new Lover merchandise? Just an idea. I mean, I&#8217;d definitely buy those.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is where Katy Perry&#8217;s one request comes into play. Because the cookies weren&#8217;t the only reason you came here, fam. In reality, Perry informed Swift that she&#8217;d come to her house mainly to meet her new kitten, Benjamin Button. And, yes, she was alluding to Swift&#8217;s &#8220;ME!&#8221; music video&#8217;s gorgeous blue-eyed kitten.</p>
<p>You know, like this:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ME! Behind The Scenes: The Story of Benjamin Button" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUf1ili4Zew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t handle the sweetness!</p>
<p>To summarise, Katy Perry extended an olive branch to Swift. Swift handed Perry some cookies before allowing her to handle her <a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/taylor-swifts-pet-cat-reported-to-be-worth-97-million-but-not-among-the-wealthiest-pets-in-the-world/">pet</a>, and the rest is Happy Meal history.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can trust her and she can trust me,&#8221; Katy Perry explained. &#8220;And I think it&#8217;s amazing that we have this opportunity to change, and I just hope that other people can learn from it, too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312670" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LefZBAB.png" alt="" width="760" height="460" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LefZBAB.png 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LefZBAB-300x182.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LefZBAB-150x91.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p>Yes, Katy!</p>
<p>You can hear her whole <a href="https://secureback.hiptoro.com/p/zendaya-leaving-acting/">interview</a> on the iHeartRadio website.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hiptoro-Thumbnail-2023-05-01T024029.572-150x150.webp" /> <div><p>Apple Martin has matured! The 18-year-old, the daughter of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, has graduated from high school. In a June 2 Instagram story, the Goop founder hailed her daughter&#8217;s huge milestone. &#8220;Congratulations to all of the graduates, especially @applemartin,&#8221; Paltrow wrote beside a beautiful family selfie of the three.</p>
<p>The snapshot shows Apple Martin in her green graduation gown, standing by her parents, who appear to be overjoyed with her scholastic achievement. Martin, who can be seen wrapping his arm around his daughter, is dressed up for the event in a black suit. Meanwhile, Paltrow was all about the accessories, with sunglasses, gold jewelry, and a summer-appropriate beige hat.</p>
<blockquote><p>The post comes just weeks after Apple Martin celebrated her 18th birthday on May 14. At the time, Paltrow shared a sweet tribute to her daughter on Instagram to mark the occasion. “I could not be more proud of the woman you are. You are everything I could have dreamed of and so much more,” Paltrow wrote alongside a photo of Apple Martin posing in the mirror. “You are deeply extraordinary in every way. Happy birthday my darling girl.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Apple Martin</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-312602 size-full" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cAKrWS0.png" alt="Apple Martin" width="760" height="1166" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cAKrWS0.png 760w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cAKrWS0-196x300.png 196w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cAKrWS0-667x1024.png 667w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cAKrWS0-150x230.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p>Apple Martin was born in May 2004, only a few months after Paltrow and Martin married in December 2003. The couple had a baby called Moses in April 2006, two years after receiving their first kid together. Paltrow and Martin were married for over a decade before they famously divorced in 2014 (the divorce was finalised in 2016). Since then, Paltrow has married writer and producer Brad Falchuk, and Martin has moved on with Fifty Shades of Grey actress Dakota Johnson. They appear to be co-parenting Apple successfully.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdi0dNDLjQ7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312620" src="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/020EJRr.png" alt="" width="582" height="911" srcset="https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/020EJRr.png 582w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/020EJRr-192x300.png 192w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/020EJRr-150x235.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>While appearing in a June 17 episode of Shop TODAY with Jill Martin, Paltrow said Martin has become like a “brother” to her through the years. “He’s my family,” she said. “I love him, and I’m so grateful to him for giving me these kids.”</p></blockquote>
