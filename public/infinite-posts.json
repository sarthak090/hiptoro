On December 29, he and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania while police looked into allegations of s*xual assault, exploitation, organized crime, and human trafficking.</p>\n<p>Romania’s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) caught the brothers along with two women in the same case.</p>\n<p>They spent 30 days in a detention center and had their time there extended several times.

The arrest was supposed to end, but it was just extended for another 30 days. This means that the brothers won’t be able to leave until at least May 29, while officials continue to look into what happened.</p>\n<p>Since he has been on house arrest, Andrew Tate has posted a number of mysterious videos and messages, including a Tweet in which he seems to say that he will be shot as soon as he is freed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I prepare my body to absorb the brutal kinetics of piercing lead,</p></blockquote>\n<p>he wrote.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As all other silencing attempts fail, and stage 3 approaches – I anticipate a bullet will be the chosen utensil of pacification. I can only pray and prepare. I will force myself to breathe the best I can. I promise.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, the former <strong>Big Brother</strong> contestant, who has denied all the accusations against him and Tristan, has said on his Twitter page that he may have been poisoned and had a bad reaction.</p>\n<p>Andrew Tate penned in a now-deleted tweet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Face swollen. Blood pressure is through the roof. Skins on fire. Hard to breathe. Some sort of severe reaction or poison. Only had coffee and water so far today. All appeared in the last 5mins,</p></blockquote>\n<p>alongside a picture and video showing the severity of the issue.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\"> \n  <div class=\"w-[500px] p-8 text-black border border-gray-200 bg-white rounded-2xl \" data-style=\"undefined\">\n    <div class=\" flex items-center justify-between\">\n      <div class=\"relative flex items-center\">\n          <img class=\"w-12 h-12 rounded-full\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1522788765344964608/iNVQdxL6_normal.jpg\" alt=\"profile img\">\n            <div class=\"ml-4\">\n              <div class=\"flex items-center\" <p=\"\">Jeckov Kanani<p></p>\n                \n              </div>\n              <a class=\"text-blue-400\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JeckovKanani\">@JeckovKanani\n              </a>\n            </div>\n      </div>\n      <svg class=\"text-blue-400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69c.88-.53 1.56-1.37 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05C18.37 4.5 17.26 4 16 4c-2.35 0-4.27 1.92-4.27 4.29c0 .34.04.67.11.98C8.28 9.09 5.11 7.38 3 4.79c-.37.63-.58 1.37-.58 2.15c0 1.49.75 2.81 1.91 3.56c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03c0 2.08 1.48 3.82 3.44 4.21a4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07a4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98a8.521 8.521 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06C3.44 20.29 5.7 21 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79c0-.19 0-.37-.01-.56c.84-.6 1.56-1.36 2.14-2.23Z\"></path></svg>\n    </div>\n      \n    <div class=\"mt-4\">\n      Andrew Tate gets \"some sort of severe reaction or poison\".

Although the mistreatment that she endures could potentially happen to any male character, it is the recurrence of such offenses against both her and her gender that is inexcusable.

However, despite her valiant efforts, she finds herself in a dangerous situation that ultimately necessitates Boruto’s intervention to protect her. This turn of events not only puts Boruto’s safety at risk but also perpetuates the problematic trend of female shinobi being portrayed as helpless and in need of male rescue, an all-too-common trope in the Naruto universe.</p>\n<h3>Boruto Manga: Undermining Sarada’s Heroic Deed</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_312646\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-312646\" style=\"width: 1632px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-312646\" src=\"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1.png\" alt=\"Boruto Manga\" width=\"1632\" height=\"866\" srcset=\"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1.png 1632w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-300x159.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1024x543.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-768x408.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1536x815.png 1536w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-1600x849.png 1600w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1-150x80.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-312646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boruto Manga</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite Sarada’s proven competence as a shinobi, her act of bravery in saving Boruto was supposed to be a pivotal moment for her character, but instead, Boruto exploited it to mock and belittle her. In risking her life to save her friend and potential love interest, she found herself in the midst of the first confrontation between two key characters at a critical point in the manga. However, the author failed to challenge the typical gender stereotypes present in fiction by portraying Sarada, who was once a heroic figure, as a “damsel in distress” who required Boruto’s intervention to rescue her, resulting in him suffering severe injuries at his own expense.</p>\n<p>\n  </p><div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px;  margin: 0 auto;\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.15%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left:0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;\" loading=\"lazy\" ;=\"\" srcdoc=\"<style>\n        * {\n        padding: 0;\n        margin: 0;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        \n        body, html {\n          height: 100%;\n        }\n        \n        img, svg {\n          position: absolute;\n          width: 100%;\n          top: 0;\n          bottom: 0;\n          margin: auto;\n        }\n        \n        svg {\n          filter: drop-shadow(1px 1px 10px hsl(206.5, 70.7%, 8%));\n          transition: all 250ms ease-in-out;\n        }\n        \n        body:hover svg {\n          filter: drop-shadow(1px 1px 10px hsl(206.5, 0%, 10%));\n          transform: scale(1.2);\n        }\n      </style>\n      <a href='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzkzhbMtD1I?autoplay=1'>\n        <img src='https://img.youtube.com/vi/DzkzhbMtD1I/hqdefault.jpg' alt='Coffee Recipe Javascript Project'>\n        <svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='64' height='64' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='#ffffff' stroke-width='2' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round' class='feather feather-play-circle'><circle cx='12' cy='12' r='10'></circle><polygon points='10 8 16 12 10 16 10 8'></polygon></svg>\n      </a>\n      \" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzkzhbMtD1I\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Boruto Manga: Handling of Sarada is Completely Disrespectful\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\n    </iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>  <p></p>\n<p>Ironically, one of Sarada’s most significant moments in the Boruto Manga was marred by the way it happened. In earlier chapters 41 and 42, Kawaki tells Sarada how to use her family’s Sharingan, despite only having learned about its abilities himself moments earlier. This could be viewed as further evidence of how Sasuke’s absence has affected Sarada’s understanding of her powers.</p>\n<h5><a title=\"[Redditors expressed disappointment and frustration at Sasuke's prolonged absence from Sarada's life]\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/ugg9rc/is_sasukes_mission_really_a_valid_excuse_for_his/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[Redditors expressed disappointment and frustration at Sasuke’s prolonged absence from Sarada’s life]</a></h5>\n<p>However, the fact that a male character had to instruct a female character on how to fight raises questions about gender roles and reinforces a troubling trend of male characters dominating and dictating female characters’ actions and abilities in the story.</p>\n<h3>Boruto Manga: Hinata’s Character Falls Prey to Stereotypical Portrayal</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_312631\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-312631\" style=\"width: 1252px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-312631\" src=\"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga.png\" alt=\"Boruto Manga\" width=\"1252\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga.png 1252w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-300x149.png 300w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-1024x510.png 1024w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-768x382.png 768w, https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-Manga-150x75.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1252px) 100vw, 1252px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-312631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boruto Manga</figcaption></figure>\n<p>These regressive and unwarranted gender biases serve to underscore how Boruto consistently mistreats its female shinobi. Hinata is perhaps the most glaring example of this. While her role as a homemaker is not inherently problematic, the series portrays her as constantly failing in this role, causing her son to comfort her while he is on the verge of risking his life. Furthermore, there are instances when Hinata supposedly fights in Boruto, but the show chooses to omit these scenes, or she is presented with an ideal adversary, such as Ao, who is infamous for murdering her clan, but has no role in his defeat. This is not to mention the vast majority of other female fighters who are either overlooked or relegated to stereotypical roles like running flower shops, despite years of battlefield experience. In light of all this, it is clear that having Sarada fail to rescue Boruto and necessitate his rescue instead is entirely disrespectful and unwarranted.</p>\n"},"tags":[{"term_id":2119,"name":"Anime","slug":"anime","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2119,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":316,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":2499,"name":"Boruto","slug":"boruto","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2499,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":94,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":33765,"name":"chapter 80","slug":"chapter-80","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":33765,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":34478,"name":"Chapter 81","slug":"chapter-81","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":34478,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":2120,"name":"Manga","slug":"manga","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2120,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":482,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":556,"name":"release date","slug":"release-date","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":556,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2184,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":14721,"name":"Sarada","slug":"sarada","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":14721,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":555,"name":"spoilers","slug":"spoilers","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":555,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":739,"filter":"raw"}],"slug":"boruto-manga-sarada","featuredImg":{"id":"Boruto-and-Sarada.png","thumbnail":"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-and-Sarada-150x150.png","medium":"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-and-Sarada-300x147.png","large":"https://static.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boruto-and-Sarada-1024x503.png"},"categories":[{"id":31014,"name":"Anime","slug":"anime"}],"category":[{"id":31014,"name":"Anime","slug":"anime"}],"author":{"name":"Vidushi","slug":"vidushi-undefined","description":"I have always loved writing and my curiosity for the entertainment business pushed me towards entertainment journalism as I like to call it Infotainment.
